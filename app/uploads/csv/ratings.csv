1,"The entry hall to the gallery is spacious and impressive. Staff were both professional and friendly. Our entry fee was kindly reduced due to our concession and educator qualifications from a different country - we found that very kind and inclusive. We only had a short time to visit so mainly concentrated on the contemporary art on Level 4. We loved the diversity of art forms in that section and the powerful commentaries conveyed by the artists through their art. The gallery shop, cafe area and child- focused sections are also excellent.",5,1,6
2,"I was very surprised because the space was so large. I really like art so when I came here I was immersed in art, I was here for 3 hours without getting bored. It is worth the money to buy tickets, very suggested for everyone !!!",5,1,1
3,"It's more than just a museum — it’s a captivating blend of art, history, and architecture that leaves a lasting impression.  Housed within the beautifully restored former Supreme Court and City Hall buildings, the Gallery itself is a masterpiece.  Interactive installations and multimedia elements add layers of engagement, making it a dynamic experience for all ages.  A space where art is not only seen but felt, and where every corner speaks to the creative soul of the region.",5,1,2
4,"A visit to this National Gallery Singapore is an absolute must, even if you're not typically an art enthusiast. Housed within the stunningly restored former City Hall and Supreme Court buildings, it stands as the world's largest collection of Singaporean and Southeast Asian modern art. While admission applies, dedicating a full day to immerse yourself in its rich cultural tapestry is highly recommended; otherwise, a minimum of half a day will still offer a deeply enriching experience.  What I like: 1.   Extensive art collections and installation: This is definitely the largest art gallery of the region. There's even an art installation on the roof top garden. 2.  Friendly staff. Don't know where to start? no worries, they always always here to help. 3.  Architectural Splendor: The seamless blend of old and new architecture, such as stunning Supreme Court Terrace, a architecture masterpiece not to be missed. 5.  Well preserved historic buildings of the former Supreme Court and City Hall : definitely Insta-worthy location. 6.  Both Padang and Coleman Observation Decks on level 6 provide a different perspective of Singapore cityscape.  Room for Improvement: There's a lack of signage or wayfinder for visitors entering from the Parliament Place/ Supreme Court entrance. Many visitors including ourselves lost our way and were not sure where to get the ticket. Same when we are trying to find our way out.",5,1,3
5,"Free admission for Singapore citizens, and it’s really a nice, cool quiet place to appreciate the art and history of Singapore. Easy walk from city hall mrt station. Basement level is catered for young kids too!",5,1,4
6,"What a lovely afternoon exploring Arab Street! The whole area is full of charm with colorful little shops and friendly vendors. I wandered around with no real plan and ended up with a delicious snack in hand and a beautiful blue pendant with green emerald details from a Turkish shop. It was such a nice surprise.  The highlight was visiting Sultan Mosque. It is absolutely gorgeous in person. The golden dome catches your eye from far away and the entire place has a peaceful and welcoming atmosphere. If you’re in Singapore, make sure to stop by. It is a perfect mix of culture, color, and calm.",5,2,5
7,"Last month, I had the chance to visit the iconic Sultan Mosque in Singapore. The architecture is absolutely stunning, the golden domes, detailed design, and peaceful atmosphere make it a must-visit. I was especially moved by the history behind the mosque, especially how the base of the dome is made with glass bottles donated by the local Muslim community. A beautiful place rich in culture, spirituality, and unity.  Highly recommended for anyone visiting Kampong Glam!",5,2,6
8,"Free entrance, and overall a really nice place to pray. There are separate entrances for men and women. The women's ablution place is near the shoe racks (there are toilets too inside). Use lift/stairs to go to the women's prayer section on the 2nd floor. There are prayer clothes (mukena) we can borrow. Big fans and electricity plugs available.",5,2,1
9,"Sultan Mosque (Masjid Sultan) in Singapore Sultan Mosque An iconic architectural landmark, the impressive Sultan Mosque is a focal point for Singapore’s Muslim community.  Iconic Golden Dome of Sultan mosque Singapore Why You Need To Visit Striking Architecture Abounds The mosque's distinctive golden domes are adorned with glass bottle ends at the base of the structure, which were collected and donated by the lower-income as their contributions to the mosque’s construction. Winner of the prestigious Architectural Award in 2016, the mosque's golden dome is so iconic, towering over nearby shophouses.  A Glimpse into the Muslim Faith Built in 1824 by Sultan Hussein Shah, the first Sultan of Singapore, the mosque is a vibrant symbol of the Muslim faith, and a focal point of Singapore's Malay community.  A Place to Expand One's Horizons The mosque welcomes visitors to explore the compound on a guided tour or a free walk.",4,2,2
10,"An iconic architectural landmark, the impressive Sultan Mosque is a focal point for Singapore’s Muslim community.  This is the largest mosque in Singapore located in the Kampong Gelam neighbourhood of Singapore.  Beautiful.  Absolutely stunning.  Worth going in the day and at night.  Try and time your visit with one of the five daily prayers so you can hear the adhan (call to prayer).  I have been to Singapore before and went inside.  I didn't go inside this time.  Highly recommend you do if you can.  Visitors can enter between 10:00 to 12:00 and 14:00 to 16:00 daily except Friday when they are closed.  All visitors are invited to explore the compound on a guided tour or a free walk.  Dress modestly or they will give you a robe to cover and remove footwear.",5,2,3
11,"Important: you are not allowed to enter wearing shoes, so my advice is to bring some socks with you in the purse so you won’t have to walk there barefoot - because honestly is not the cleanest floor you could walk on. My socks were trashed after visiting it. The temple is very beautiful and colorful. If you have very short pants/skirt there is a nice person there who guides you to some skirts that you can tie over your own. The paintings are very vivid, and the multitude of deities is impressive. Outside they have some presentation for some of them. Overall was a nice experience and the people there are very friendly.",4,3,2
12,"Sri Mariamman Temple, located in the heart of Singapore’s Chinatown, is the city’s oldest and most significant Hindu temple, established in 1827. Dedicated to the goddess Mariamman, revered for her healing powers, the temple showcases intricate Dravidian architecture, with a vibrant gopuram (entrance tower) adorned with multicolored sculptures of deities and mythological figures.  Visitors often highlight the temple’s serene atmosphere and spiritual ambiance. While some note that the temple is relatively small and can be explored in about 10–15 minutes, its rich cultural significance and ornate details make it a worthwhile stop, especially when exploring Chinatown.  The temple is open to tourists, who are required to remove their shoes before entering. Photography is permitted for a small fee.",4,3,3
13,"Location is in the Chinatown area and is very easy to spot even from a farther distance. It’s free to enter but there are basic requirements to enter such as leaving your shoes outside which they have added a shoe rack spot to the right of the entrance, dress in a respectful manner, and no video recording in some areas of the temple.  The temple’s inside and outside are gorgeous with colorful paintings on the inside walls, color scheme just pops on both the inside and outside and the temple just stands out from it’s neighboring buildings. Definitely recommend to visit when you’re in the area and have some free time.",5,3,4
14,"Walking into Sri Mariamman Temple felt like stepping into a living painting. The vibrant colors, intricate carvings, and peaceful energy made the whole space feel sacred and alive. The details on the temple’s facade are stunning, and once inside, everything feels serene and full of meaning.  Just a little heads-up, you’ll need to take your shoes off before entering the temple grounds, so wear something easy to slip off. I didn’t have to wait at all to get in, and the experience left me with a calm heart and a deep sense of wonder. If you’re curious about spirituality, love colorful architecture, or just want a quiet moment in the middle of the city, this place is a ge",5,3,5
15,"This small temple was right across from the hotel where I stayed. On my first day, I happened to pass by while a religious ceremony was taking place, and it was open for the public to join. It was a really beautiful sight.  The temple’s bright and colorful gopuram (entrance tower) is a real showstopper, covered in intricate carvings of Hindu deities and mythical figures. It’s such a striking sight that it immediately draws your attention. Definitely worth stopping by for a closer look!",5,3,6
16,"The Armenian Church of St Gregory the Illuminator, is an amazing place to enjoy peaceful moments with yourself, praying and praising our Almighty God. Beautifully built church with nice and meaningful sculptures, one of which is Jesus Christ with cross. I love everything about that place. God bless you all ??",5,4,1
17,"A very beautiful and well maintained church, albeit small, especially when compared to other churches within the vicinity. As the oldest church in Singapore, it appears to be simple, humble yet rich in history.  Too bad we didn't get the chance to visit inside the church as it was closed to the public for a private event.",4,4,2
18,I highly recommend a visit to Singapore's first church built in the early 1800's. Armenians have played an integral role in the development of Singapore from the Raffles Hotel to Armenian Street.  A visit (by appointment) to the museum on the church grounds is also worth it to further understand the rich history of Armenians in Singapore.,5,4,3
19,The oldest church in Singapore. Friendly to visitors as the gate are always open during the day.,5,4,4
20,"A little piece of history, piety and culture in the middle of the city. When I visited this place, there wasn't much people, so it was very serene and quiet all around the church and garden. I just hope they would maximize this place, not just as a historical site, but also as a church and cultural center. I wonder if, aside from weddings, Eastern Rite liturgies are still celebrated here?",5,4,5
21,"The historical CHIJMES building, located in the heart of Singapore’s vibrant Orchard Road area, offers one of the most beautiful settings surrounded by lush greenery. It houses a stunning former church alongside a variety of food and beverage outlets. A wonderful destination for both tourists, visitors and locals to explore and unwind.",4,5,3
22,This place features beautiful architecture and also offers a variety of restaurants. It’s perfect for enjoying a meal with family and strolling around to admire the stunning buildings. It’s also easy to get to — I traveled there by bus.,5,5,4
23,"CHIJMES is such a beautiful and peaceful place with stunning architecture. I truly appreciated the respectful atmosphere and the sense of history there. The area is very clean, the people around were kind, and I felt so happy to discover such a charming and meaningful spot. Best to visit in the morning or early afternoon, as it can get quite hot later in the day. A lovely place for quiet reflection and tasteful photos.",5,5,5
24,"Old building but super aesthetic, lots of photo spots, and great selection of restaurants/bars. Perfect for chilling or a relaxed evening walk. The vibe is really different from other places in Singapore!",5,5,6
25,"Walking into CHIJMES felt like accidentally stepping into a peaceful, storybook world, except this one comes with wine bars and really good lighting.  By day, it’s like the city took a deep breath and made a little space just to chill. The old chapel is stunning, and if you look closely at the top of the columns, you’ll find tropical flowers and birds carved in, like someone said, “Let’s make this place gorgeous, but make it extra.” And they did.  One of the most touching spots? A little gate called the Gate of Hope on Victoria Street. This was where babies were once left to be cared for by nuns. Yeah, I know, suddenly you’re not just sipping an iced latte in a pretty place, you’re standing in living history. Wild, right?  But then… the sun sets. And bam, CHIJMES transforms into this lively, sparkling maze of restaurants and bars. One second you’re in quiet reflection mode, next you’re Googling “How many tapas is too many tapas?” while live music spills out from somewhere nearby. There’s food from everywhere, Spain, India, maybe even your future favorite.  It’s elegant without being stiff, historical without being dusty, and social without being overwhelming. I came here for the architecture and stayed for the sangria. Ten out of ten, would accidentally become a regular here.",5,5,1
26,"Located at the heart of Singapore Civic district, this oldest Anglican Cathedral is a historical charm. Its stunning Neo-Gothic architectural style, featuring tall white columns and beautifully arched ceilings that create a sense of serenity.  The white exterior made it really stands out among the modern concrete. Its interior, however, looks rather simple in comparison and the church is smaller than I thought. That said, it is worthwhile stop for prayer, reflection, or simply to admire its beauty.",3,6,2
27,"Very beautiful church, open to the public. We arrived when the people were preparing to have service so we left pretty fast. The stained glass windows are wonderful.",5,6,3
28,"A peaceful and awe-inspiring place to visit in the heart of the city. The cathedral’s architecture is stunning, with tall white columns and beautifully arched ceilings that create a sense of serenity. I was able to walk in without any wait, and the staff were kind and welcoming.  Whether you’re here to pray, reflect, or simply admire the beauty of the space, it’s absolutely worth stopping by. Quiet, calming, and full of historical charm.",5,6,4
29,"St Andrew Cathedral also known as 圣安德烈座堂 in chinese is a national monument located in City Hall. It has a rich history and cultural heritage and is definitely worth visiting. While strolling in the courtyard, you might be greeted by sights of sagat seeds scattered across the ground. There are many sagat trees in the vicinity as this is one of the most commonly planted trees by NParks in Singapore. St Andrew's Neo-Gothic architectural style is impressive to say the least and there are many rustic artefacts that can be found in the Cathedral itself. The interior of the Cathedral boasts of beautifully crafted glass windows which are dedicated to the founder of Singapore  Raffles, the second resident of Singapore, John Crawford  and the Governor of Singapore, Major General William Butterford. Across the street is Funan mall, where there are plenty of food options. For those wishing to visit the Cathedral, take note that the visitor centre is only open on Tuesdays to Saturdays from 10 am to 4 pm.",5,6,5
30,"Singapore's Anglican church Cathedral  - large, inpressive, and, which is most important to me personally, extremely welcoming to the visitors like me: starting from their beautiful, spacious and relaxing visitors centre on to very informative route planners and narrative posters all around its premises. Well done, God bless you, kind people of St. Andrew's!",5,6,6
31,It is a stage outside the Tooth Relic Temple and Chinatown Complex Market and Food Centre. Not big.  Sometimes there are live performances there. Best to hear the songs sung by the artistes from level 2 food centre while having a meal with some breeze from the wall fans.  On a daily basis some elderly would gather to play chess or simply chitchatting.  It is also commonly known as the meeting place before a walking tour starts.,4,7,1
32,"Its located opposite the Tooth Relic Temple, near the Chinatown Street Market and one of the entrance of China Town Complex. Its a square with a stage for performance during special occasions like lunar new year. This is also the gathering place for old folks to chit chat or to play a game of chess.",4,7,2
33,"12 life-sized tiger displays currently at Kreta Ayer Square (Open space between Buddha Relic Temple and Chinatown Complex) - Exhibition is ongoing from now till 15 February 2022.  This is an initative to raise the awareness of  tiger conservation as we welcome the Year of Tiger. Painted by local artists, injecting different personalities to these tigers.  Can be crowded as many were taking photos. Nice place to go after dining at Chinatown Complex",4,7,3
34,This Square is nearly not as interesting as they say. The surrounding area is far nicer to take a walk and explore.,3,7,4
35,"Located right by Chinatown Complex. On weekends they're always crowded, filled with old uncles and aunties who are hanging out here playing chess or dancing. Occasionally there are folk dances happening, but for the most part, it's just a very exciting sight, especially if you're into the whole Chinatown ambience.",4,7,5
36,"It's worth a visit to try out some local food or buy some souvenirs. Walk down the street and also around the corner, as there are other shops/stalls, including a Starbucks in a beautiful colourful building. There are food stalls, restaurants and other Shops that sell souvenirs. It's located next to the Chinatown Complex",4,9,4
37,Very interesting place to visit where you'll find lots of shops and restaurants with different Chinese cuisines!,5,9,5
38,"The retro-style snack street, and the old brother who does henna tattoos there has great skills.",5,9,6
39,"Food is good and have a great service. Very kid friendly staff. Wish i didnt have  stomache bug the night before this day, coz id love to devour that crab",5,9,1
40,Good Chinese food you can find over there lots of choices nice clean place too and especially the DURIAN. Also many souvenirs to choose from,4,9,2
41,"TC, the trishaw rider, was an excellent guide! He shared many interesting facts and secrets around the house. The place is filled with all sorts of items from the past! Very interesting learning about everything. Downstairs there is a shop full of Singapore souvenirs and a special tea shop. Highly recommend to come here. Full air conditioned too!",5,10,1
42,What a great place to learn about developing Chinatown within Singapore. This place was super informative and interactive. I learned so much here going through the different exhibits and rich history that was provided. Definitely a must visit when touring through Singapore.,5,10,2
43,"Highly recommended to plan a visit here for those who wants to learn about the life in Chinatown pre-independence. Highly experiential learning opportunity here.  Great amount of care to recreate the days past and highly interactive displays to bring to life the daily living of the past generation.  Hopefully, it will show how much we have to be grateful for the life we have nowadays.",5,10,3
44,"Pretty fun, well-thought and curated museum that gives you a glimpse of the genesis of Chinatown in Singapore, through the lense of migrant workers, how they lived and earned a living, and how it all set a foundation for the modern yet traditional lifestyle we all know today. Well kept and comfortably air-conditioned. Worth a visit for sure, but I felt the tickets were a bit on the pricey side.",4,10,4
45,"Today was the perfect opportunity to visit the Chinatown Heritage Centre, especially since we missed the soft launch. We had no regrets booking our tickets online and making the visit. Although our reservation was for 3 PM, we arrived earlier, and the attendants kindly allowed us entry.  It was a quiet afternoon with fewer visitors, giving us the chance to explore at our own pace, read the exhibits, and take photos without obstruction. Our first impression was that the place is well-maintained and clean. It was truly an eye-opening experience to learn about Singapore’s history and the struggles of early immigrants who arrived in Nanyang, hoping to find prosperity.  This heritage centre is an insightful visit, especially for younger generations, as it provides valuable knowledge about our ancestors who settled here. The centre also offers videos that showcase historical events and experiences. However, visitors should be mindful when walking down the narrow and dimly lit staircase—we chose not to take the lift.  Overall, it’s a highly recommended visit for anyone interested in Singapore’s rich heritage.",5,10,5
46,I visited the Thian Hock Keng temple and it was a very peaceful visit. This is the oldest temple in Singapore and has Chinese heritage in terms of the impressive architecture. The temple is open during day time and you don't need a ticket to enter. There are incence and candles available for free but a donation is recommended. It has some areas where photography is prohibited but the main temple grounds is not. Highly recommended!,5,11,5
47,"Thian Hock Keng Temple is an example of traditional Chinese architecture and one of Singapore’s oldest temples.  Admission is free, and the temple is well-maintained with informative plaques for visitors.  Be mindful in hot weather - the smell from traditional burnings can be quite intense, better to bring some water. Also there are parts where photos and videos are not allowed to provide privacy to those who pray.",5,11,6
48,"Thian Hock Keng is one of the earliest Chinese temples in Singapore. Located in the bustling city center, it is popular with both tourists and locals. The temple features beautiful historical Chinese architecture and is well maintained.",5,11,1
49,"Located in the business district of Singapore, Thian Hock Keng Temple is a stunning example of traditional Chinese architecture and one of Singapore’s oldest temples. The temple is dedicated to the revered sea goddess Mazu (妈祖 or 南海娘娘) and other deities for worshipping. The intricate carvings, vibrant colors, and detailed craftsmanship are truly impressive. Worth the visit to experience and immerse in the different Chinese heritages.",5,11,2
50,"Thian Hock Keng Temple is probably the oldest Chinese temple in Singapore. A Haokkien temple. An unique information. Though made in 1842, this excellent structure has no nails. The building has an influence of the design of Southern part of China. It is situated in Telok Ayer Street, about 10 minutes walking distance from China Town.",4,11,3
51,Such an amazing place to discover Eurasian roots and the olden days Singapore. It’s like a mini museum but it has quite a myriad of artefacts. It is well worth a visit!,5,12,5
52,"I would have given 4.5 stars for the exhibition but we had the strangest experience upon entering which in fact deserves one star. The female at the counter assumed I was a foreigner (foreigners pay a small sum to enter). I told her I was PR and my daughter a citizen. Instead of politely asking for my ID she very roughly demanded “show me” twice. I wanted a nice experience for my 8yo daughter so I complied without fuss. She then turned to my young girl and said she must pay. I was confused. I repeated that my daughter was a local Singaporean but she refused to believe me. It’s only when my Singaporean husband entered that she backed down. Nice introduction to the Eurasian community!  Unfortunately they no longer have an activity book/pack for children so I hope if they read this they’ll reintroduce one as the children would gain far more from the actual exhibition.  As for the exhibit itself, it’s quite good though a little crammed with information but I understand space is a constraint.  Would recommend if you’re combining a trip with the gorgeous downstairs Eurasian restaurant “Quentins” which my family and I love. Otherwise, given the odd reception by that woman, I’d give the exhibit a miss.",3,12,6
53,Just joined the Eurasian Association and was there for a welcoming ceremony. Our race is often forgotten being a minority race in Singapore. Come on down to EA and know more about us. The gallery is on the 4th floor,5,12,1
54,First time here. A quiet place with comprehensive information you need to know about Eurasian community. Lot of interesting fun facts. There is a restaurant on the ground floor serving Eurasian food but I didn’t have time to try it. Maybe next time.,5,12,2
55,"Absolutely loved the gallery! Quite small and located on the floors above, there is a lot of history packed into such a small place. I was fascinated by all the memorabilia and stories about the western influence on Singapore. I was even amazed to find my own surname which is quite localised to where I am from displayed amongst the collection with a coat of arms and the reference used which influenced the naming of a street. I spent about 30 mins although could have easily spent an hour going through all of the gallery.",5,12,3
56,It’s okay.  The atrium space has a few popular restaurants and it can get quite busy at night.,4,13,2
57,If u were born in the 60/70s there is a chance u have been here before and it was a movies and Makan chill date place,5,13,3
58,Beautifully decorated. Posh and chic.,4,13,4
59,A nice & chill place for a lunch gathering with old friends. Would love to visit again. ??❤️  The carrot cake in the cafe really looks cute. It tastes good as well ?,5,13,5
60,"As a retail mall,  there is only one tiny baby changing room at level B2, which is so super tiny and narrow that it does not allow parents to push in their strollers.  Not family friendly at all for families with babies.  The concierge person gave us wrong info that every floor has a baby changing/nursing room,  we explored every floor and there is only one such tiny room on B2. We ended up trying to find at Capitol Kempinski hotel,  and this hotel was so closely guarded that we almost could not enter.  The hotel also does not have a baby changing/ nursing room.",1,13,6
61,"A truly iconic place in Singapore!  As someone who enjoys music, culture, and peaceful scenic spots, I really love visiting the Esplanade. Whether I’m here to catch a show, meet friends, or just unwind by the bay, this place always feels special.  The architecture alone is something else — that “durian” look always catches the eye. Inside, the concert halls are world-class. Great sound, comfortable seating, and you really feel immersed in the performance. I once caught a live performance here and it gave me goosebumps.  What I also like is that the whole area outside is super relaxing. You get an amazing view of Marina Bay Sands, and the vibe at night is peaceful and inspiring. There are often buskers and pop-up art displays, which makes the walk around even more lively.  Perfect spot for both tourists and locals like me who just need a break from the city buzz without going too far. Highly recommended if you’re into the arts or just want a chill evening with beautiful views.",5,14,2
62,"I didn’t know what to expect when I visited Esplanade ,Theatres on the Bay, but it turned out to be an amazing experience! The building itself is really cool to look at, and there’s a great vibe in the area. I caught a free performance at the outdoor theatre, and it was surprisingly good! The location is also perfect right by the waterfront and Marina Bay Sands. There are also cafes and small galleries to explore inside. Great spot to relax, take photos, and enjoy some culture",4,14,3
63,"The rooftop view was amazing!!! Caught 2 free performances before leaving. Highly recommend going on weekends or public holidays. There are shops, restaurants and free performances. Best place to spend a day?",5,14,4
64,"The Esplanade Concert Hall is very comfortable, with perfect air-conditioning and a smooth, well-organized entry and exit. The sound system was excellent, and the Cat 1 , Circle 1 and 2  seats had a great view. However, the view from Circle 3 may not be suitable for concerts.""",4,14,5
65,"my favorite place to spend a Saturday night. Great free performances, the waterfront and beautiful bright lights, what's there not to like.",5,14,6
66,"This was an extremely well thought out, family friendly and delightful attraction. It was so much fun to see how tickled the families and kids were as they went through the Jurassic exhibit. The orchids and the plants and the special exhibits were absolutely amazing. It is not hyperbole to say that it was an absolutely thrilling experience. And I thought the cost was more than fair. It was $46 for an adult for the day. And there was plenty to see that didn’t cost anything. This is a must see when you come to Singapore. I included a photo of the bathroom sinks to show you that the children were included in the planning process. That sink is the perfect height for a 4 to 5 year-old to use.",5,15,2
67,"We loved Gardens by the Bay. We took the lift to the observation deck for a 360° view. A walk around the lake enjoying the green space and shade as it was a very hot day. The cloud dome and flower dome were incredible, and the dinosaurs were great fun. So much more I would have liked to explore, but that will have to wait for next time. Public green space on this size is a credit to Singapore ??",5,15,3
68,"What an incredible experience there is so much to see and do here. We took to audio tour before entering the park, which was a great way to explore the park before heading into the enclosures/domes.  Lots to feast your eyes on and at every turn there is a new surprise.  Great for all ages and most areas are fully accessible for those with disabilities.  Don’t miss out on seeing it. We sadly left this to our last day and weren’t able to enjoy the night light spectacular, which we saw from afar, again a must see magnificent sight.",5,15,4
69,"Gardens by the Bay is a must-see in Singapore! We really enjoyed our time there, you could easily spend a whole day exploring it all. The glasshouses are the highlight; both the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome are amazing, with a great mix of plants and flowers and some fun surprises along the way. It’s very family friendly, with a few dining spots, but be ready for a fair bit of walking. The Supertrees are also well worth a visit. The whole place is huge and beautifully maintained. Absolutely recommend!",5,15,5
70,"Gardens by the Bay is a beautiful and massive place — definitely a walk-heavy experience, so if you’re looking to burn some calories while enjoying nature, this is the perfect spot! The area is filled with lush greenery, showcasing a wide variety of plants and trees from around the world. It’s creatively designed and gives you a truly unique and refreshing experience.  Make sure to stay hydrated — the place is huge, and you’ll be walking a lot. Overall, a wonderful experience and a great example of how Singapore continues to amaze with its innovation and natural beauty.",4,15,6
71,"A one of a kind place to live. It is one iconic building in Singapore. It has everything you need, gym, pool, small grocery stores, clinic, barbershop, etc. The bust stop is right in front and has the other two very convenient bus stops a short walk away.",5,16,4
72,"Designed by the great Ole Schereen, partner at the OMA, this is a fabulous residential project. The moment you step in, you'd realise why it was honored with the Building of the Year 2015! The experience of being in this place is so enthralling and exciting, as from no single place you'd find the volumes to look similar. With each step and turn you unravel beautiful volumes and great design aesthete.",5,16,5
73,"I absolutely loved living at The Interlace in Singapore! This condo is a true architectural marvel, boasting a distinctive “stacked” design that’s both eye-catching and functional. The sprawling grounds are surrounded by lush greenery?, and the extensive facilities—like swimming pools?‍♂️, gyms?️, and communal spaces—help foster a warm, vibrant community vibe. Plus, its strategic location makes commuting effortless, with plenty of shopping, dining?️, and entertainment spots just a stone’s throw away. If you’re seeking a home that combines bold design, modern conveniences, and a friendly neighborhood spirit, The Interlace is definitely worth considering!",5,16,6
74,"The Interlace, One of the expats favorite iconic development at all time. I’ve just leased an unit within a day with overwhelming response! Lush of greenery, spacious landscaping and shops within the compound. Best of all, not only the easy access location and most of the the units came with generously good sizes and great view!",5,16,1
75,"The Interlace is an awe-inspiring structure that resembles a giant stack of colorful Lego blocks. The architecture is truly unique and a sight to behold. The high-end condominiums within the building are luxurious and offer a comfortable living experience. The surrounding lush greenery is a refreshing sight in the midst of the city. Overall, the Interlace is a masterpiece of design that's worth a visit for architecture enthusiasts and anyone looking for a unique living experience.",5,16,2
76,"We’ve stayed here three times and have generally had very good experiences. However, during our most recent visit, we encountered some challenges at the front desk that impacted our stay. Due to a medical situation involving an injured member of our group, we requested a change in room location to better accommodate their condition. Unfortunately, we felt that our concerns were not met with the level of responsiveness or support we had previously experienced. What could have been a relatively simple adjustment became a prolonged and exhausting process.  We were eventually offered new rooms two days later, but by then, we were too worn out to move again.  That said, we would like to recognize Samuel Lee, the Assistant Front Office Manager, who made a significant difference on our last day. He took the time to listen, understand our concerns, and offer genuine reassurance. His professionalism and care restored our confidence in the service we had come to appreciate and it is largely because of this positive interaction with Samuel that we would return.  On another note, we also noticed some areas for improvement in the Executive Lounge. There is of lack attention to detail in the service of certain dishes, drinks, and the setup of the mini buffets(cheese platters with not the right cheese knives,no spoons to scoop honey/jams). Orders were occasionally mixed up, the quality of the coffee could be enhanced. With a bit more consistency and attentiveness, the overall experience in the lounge could better match the standards expected at this level of hospitality.",4,17,3
77,"We booked three nights for a family holiday during our stopover in Singapore. The hotel seemed modern and appealing. Unfortunately, the music at reception was so loud that it was difficult to understand the staff behind their desks during check-in. It could be the other way around, too, as the promised extra bed never arrived. The really unpleasant smell in the room was only addressed after repeated inquiries. You have to wait for breakfast because the restaurant can't keep up with the number of guests the hotel can accommodate. Despite the staff's generous efforts to accommodate this with a great deal of friendliness, I can only give it a clear recommendation—rather mediocre and definitely not top-notch.",3,17,4
78,"The hanging gardens are absolutely stunning and make this hotel feel like no other. A unique blend of urban luxury and tropical nature. It genuinely felt like living in a tropical oasis right in the heart of the city.  The natural light in the room made the space feel much larger and more open, and the glass shower overlooking the city added a special touch that made the stay feel truly memorable and luxurious.  The breakfast was good, with a decent variety and quality. But what stood out most was the exceptional service: truly 10 out of 10. The staff were attentive, warm, and made the experience seamless and elevated.",5,17,5
79,"Really love the greenery of the whole hotel when I walk in. Amazing design, cozy and relax. They have one of the most amazing hotel buffet in Singapore. I am a buffet lovers, and this one really caught my heart. I always come back for their lobster buffet, incredible standards, a lot of varieties of lobster, even have the most amazing Sarawak pepper lobster flavour. So fragrant, the spiciness is just nice.",5,17,6
80,"We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The staff were very friendly, the service was excellent, and the view was amazing. The location is also great—close to an MRT station and surrounded by plenty of food options. I would highly recommend staying here, and I’d definitely come back myself.",5,17,1
81,"Writing this review in response to how my application was handled very poorly  I will admit I submitted it late by a day, but that was due to the staff's inadequate knowledge and told me to use an OpenCert which was wrong so I had to go find my physical certs and that wasted time  But all that does not justify why I applied the same time as a friend who just finished her A Levels, both went in at the start of February right after the Open House. She auditioned in late February and got in. While mine was pushed so far until mid April and what I noticed was of the 7 candidates, 5 were from ITE, as we found out while waiting, and this led me to believe they think that A Level & Poly students alike are ""smarter"" and ITE ones are ""stupider"" And 1 of the 7 was from Poly whose first slot was in Feb, but missed it and got another slot in Apr!  Ultimately I was rejected and while upset, is not the focal point of my review, rather the way my certs got me treated.  LASALLE should NOT be picky based on their certs and as such us ITE students have no chance to appeal as ""it is too late in the semester"" but those who audition earlier can as they were given earlier slots. Seemingly based on certs. Those who apply first should audition first, and not have LASALLE cherry pick slots for candidates based on certs.  I wanted a Diploma in Performance so much but given how they treated me, I won't at all be shocked if my slot for the AY2026 gets pushed to April.  Time will tell as to the validity of my claims. If once again I get delayed, it's clear they want to give less priorities to Higher NITEC holders  Because if this is the case and I get shelved to Apr 2026, I will NOT be returning to LASALLE. At this point, their claims to give students equal opportunities and overlook differences such as disabilities (I have some), race or qualifications. All of that all feels like lip service to exude a positive image  I'm not making excuses to soften the blow of rejection, but recapping how unfair it is to be unable to appeal because I ""auditioned late"". I only ""auditioned late"" only because they kept me until the last slot, 15 April when I applied on 3 February  If I get the last slot again, it is clear that despite their ""equal opportunities"" claim, LASALLE gives priority to A level and Poly diploma holders, and give less opportunities to Higher NITEC holders. My application for AY2026 was submitted the day after my rejection, being mid May 2025 and will be with the general intake in Oct 2025. So there is no excuse to delay me to May 2026 then unless they truly segregate based on qualifications  If I get delayed again to Apr 2026 for the last slot with other ITE graduates, I will void my application and pursue my dreams of being an actor elsewhere, anywhere where I do not get segregated because of my certs. -- In short, I was given the last audition in Apr for a Diploma in Performance in February. I was rejected and I couldn't appeal because I auditioned late. And I only auditioned late because LASALLE gave me a late slot. And when I arrived I was with mostly ITE graduates many of whom applied in late March, even April and mine was in early February, which to me means slots are given based on certs and not a matter of first come first serve. In film, rejection will happen, but the lead up to it is what frustrates me  I'm still very heartbroken as I applied in February and wasted months until April and turned away in May. Honestly I want to withdraw my application for AY2026 seeing how I was held back. My ambition was just learn the craft of being an actor  And a large part is due to LASALLE shelving ITE students until the end, where it's too late to appeal. For rejection, I've accepted it. If someone outdid me, that is fair and square. I applied early yet was kept until the last slot where I can't appeal. And that is what hurts me so much. If I could appeal like those with early slots, I would not be writing this. But I could not, hence the review.  This review is not to hurt LASALLE's image. I only wanted to bring to light what I went through",1,18,4
82,"The art school building is absolutely breathtaking, almost like something straight out of Westworld, which was actually filmed there. Its futuristic and one-of-a-kind design makes it well worth a visit. Unfortunately, the experience was spoiled by a rude security guard who insisted that sitting was completely forbidden—no benches, no steps, nowhere at all. So, if you're just passing through and hoping to take in the sights, don’t count on being able to sit and relax for even a moment.",2,18,5
83,"As a visitor to Singapore, I found LASALLE College of the Arts by chance and was captivated by its architecture.  I explored the exterior and took a number of photos, but could not explore inside.  Designed by Singapore-based RSP Architects, the campus is an ingenious exercise of reworking space. From the outside, visitors are confronted by a black monolithic exterior of stone and aluminium punctuated with irregularly-shaped windows.  This illusion of continuity disappears when visitors enter the building, with its six seven-storey-high buildings, linked by an atrium and sky bridges. In contrast to its exterior, the buildings here are stunningly graphic, with faceted glass walls and individual panels framed in black, each tilting at different angles.",4,18,6
84,Beautiful and artistic building. Nice place for some IG pictures. Its a ART school but open to public. Love the open Lift concept. Interesting place. Easy access via Rochor MRT.,4,18,1

87,"The Kranji War Memorial, located in Singapore, is a poignant tribute to the sacrifices made by soldiers during World War II, particularly highlighting the contributions of Indian soldiers who fought valiantly in the face of adversity. The memorial stands as a solemn reminder of the bravery and dedication of those who laid down their lives for freedom.  As you enter the memorial grounds, you are greeted by beautifully manicured lawns and rows of gravestones that tell the stories of countless soldiers. The serene environment invites reflection and remembrance, making it an ideal place for visitors to pay their respects. The memorial features a striking columbarium, where the ashes of many soldiers are interred, alongside a wall inscribed with the names of those who were lost but not found.  What is particularly fascinating about Kranji War Memorial is its emphasis on the role of Indian soldiers in the war. Many Indian troops fought under British command, displaying immense courage and resilience. The memorial highlights their significant contributions, which are often overshadowed in broader historical narratives. This recognition fosters a deeper understanding of the diverse backgrounds of those who fought for liberation.  Visiting Kranji is an enlightening experience, as it encourages visitors to reflect on the complexities of colonial history and the sacrifices made by individuals from various backgrounds. The memorial also serves as an educational resource, shedding light on the lesser-known aspects of World War II in Southeast Asia.  In conclusion, Kranji War Memorial is not just a site of remembrance; it is a powerful testament to the shared history and sacrifices of soldiers from different cultures. It stands as a reminder of the importance of acknowledging and honoring all those who fought for peace and freedom, making it a must-visit for anyone interested in history and remembrance.",5,19,4
88,"A visit well taken to the poignant Kranji War Memorial today.  A big thank you to the groundskeepers for their meticulous care, and very special thanks to Ben for his kindness by offering me a temporary parasol to shade me from the sweltering afternoon sun whilst I was sketching - I didn’t even ask for it, he just plonked a parasol above me! ❤️  Lest We Forget. ?❤️",5,19,5

107,"You need to visit this temple as it holds insane serene energy! You can simply sit there next to the wall, observe prayers or pray yourself, but even absorbing the energy of the place is already healing and inspiring. Don’t treat it as a sightseeing, treat it as a sacred space where you can charge your spiritual batteries ✨  It’s free of charge. You may donate some money if you feel so. Don’t forget to cover your shoulders and knees. But they also have some cloth to borrow in case you came unprepared",5,24,3
108,"Felt very proud to see such a wonderful and well maintained Indian temple in Singapore. Every single statue is so elegant and exquisitely carved. The detailing is breathtaking. The silver and gold work too is rich and mesmerizing. Prasadam is kept in a basket for the devotees, wrapped in cute small betel leaves. The best part of the temple is the energising fragrance of the temple premises which is a mix of ghee lamps, incense sticks and fresh flowers offerings to Kali Mata",5,24,4
109,"My visit to Sri Veeramakaliamman Temple in Little India was a standout moment. This temple, dedicated to Goddess Kali  and Parvati, is open daily from 5:30 AM–12:30 PM and 4:00 PM–9:30 PM (closed midday)  ￼. Visitors are welcomed with open arms—just remember to leave your shoes at the entrance and dress modestly (cover shoulders and knees; wraps are provided free if needed)  ￼.  The exterior is an absolute visual feast: the façade bursts with bright pastel colors, intricate carvings, and rows of sculpted deities and mythical creatures in vivid detail . The gopuram (tower) is especially spectacular, stacked with figures in perfect harmony  ￼. Built in the Dravidian style, the temple dates back to 1881—with roots stretching even earlier into a small 1855 shrine  ￼.  Inside and out, it’s a dazzling blend of culture, artistry, and devotion. Everything is well-maintained and deeply vibrant. Even if you didn’t go in, the energy and beauty from the outside give a strong preview of the spiritual richness within.  Highly recommend carving out time during your Little India visit—you’ll leave feeling inspired and uplifted.",5,24,5

111,"As a Singaporean, I try not to give places of interest bad ratings to promote Singapore's tourism scene. However, even I am having a hard time singing praises of Maghain Aboth Synagogue. If not for a friendly french guide with a humble disposition, this rating would have been alot worse. I discovered this synagogue through SgFest and was directed to their website where I made my booking. Upon arrival, I was told to pass my IC to the guard, which i did so. They asked me to show them my email, which i also did so. I passed my phone to their security, and while scrolling the mail, the mail was sent accidentally to my spam mail. That was when all my woes started. They said that I did not show them the mail and demanded to see it again. At this time, I did not know it was sent to my spam mail. After checking every folder in 2 google email accounts, I finally found the ticket in my spam mail. In total, I had to surrender my IC twice, had my pouch(with a powerbank) checked twice. In the process of surrendering my IC, my wad of dollar bills fell out of my wallet. After collecting my composure and completing the compulsory paperwork, I told the security that things were disorganized and disorderly here. I was told if I did not like it, I could leave. Seriously? What kind of hospitality is this you are showing to your guests? I actually took up the guard's challenge and headed to the exit where the guard stopped me and asked me to proceed on. You could visit any religious place of worship in Singapore and not be treated in this disrespectful manner. Very poor hospitality on Maghain Aboth Synagogue on their part. The only saving grace is their guide who spoke English with great clarity. However, I did not learn much about the Jewish community during this visit as I was totally pissed off.",2,25,1
112,"Informative place that provides insight into the life of Jews in Singapore, a minority community here. There are a total of 5 synagogues in Singapore. Some of the prominent Jews here include David Marshall, Jacob Bellas etc. This synagogue is centrally located, there’s a Jewish supermarket selling kosher food, a small museum and you can enter the synagogue to take a look during non-prayer times.",4,25,2

I got to see a beautiful blend of science, technology, and art in a way that felt both futuristic and deeply creative.  One of the most impressive exhibitions was about fashion and sustainability. They showcased recycled materials turned into actual wearable high-fashion pieces. It wasn’t just for show. These were real outfits worn by celebrities, and every single piece looked stunning. The craftsmanship and design were on another level.  What amazed me the most was learning how each piece was made. The process was detailed, thoughtful, and innovative. It made me appreciate how art and science can work together to change the way we think about fashion and the environment.  Every room in the museum had something to admire.

152,"It could be a must visit. Tho i wouldn't recommend buying tickets in advance. There are exhibitions on site and their tickets are available on-site. You might need to buy tickets for exhibitions upon arrival.  The outside has a shallow pond with lilly. Its beautiful and calm. I would recommend seating on the pond side and admire the Lilly and the tiny little fish. The exhibitions were detailed and worth the price, i liked the one with lights. They have a cafeteria and toilets.",5,33,5
153,"While planning my trip to Singapore, I heard about the Iris van Herpen exhibition. As I admire this designer, I booked my tickets in advance. The architecture is  beautiful, from the outside and the inside. A lot of photos spots everywhere. I didn't have to queue because I bought my ticket inadvance. Even for a weekday, there were a lot of people. The atmosphere inside the museum is incredible. The staff was nice. The exhibition was one of the highlights of my discovery of Singapore. The installations were so beautiful, putting forward the work of the designer. It was scenic.",5,33,6
154,A great place to visit especially if you got kids. They have exhibitions and interactive areas like Future World. Each place has a separate entry fee which can be brought online or at the counter. Future World is very immersive and fun. The museum structure is unique and picture worthy.,5,33,1
155,"Lovely quite experience; expected the future of the world to be bigger with more activities but its ok we spent nice creative time as a family there.  We had complementary tickets to the the Iris Van Herpen and glad we got them, what a beautiful exhibition, amazing work, very inspiring and out of this world.  Would love to visit it again without kids to have more time to appreciate her art.  Really impressed.",4,33,2
156,"There are some nice exhibitions here at the time of my visit five days ago, ticket for 6 local dollars, relatively cheap in local standards.  You can see some artistic videos which are shown as artworks, and also some very contemporary conception and representatiom of different arts. It worths to pay a visit if you like arts especially cinematic arts. But if you just want to see some fine arts, you would need to wait for opening of the other galleries.  The main museum was nearly closed, probably under renovation.There was only a free exhibition there showing the museum history. I don't know why the art museum of such a developed state would be nearly closed anytime!",4,34,1
157,"Marvelous exhibitions at the SAM at 8Q, an extension of the Singapore Art Museum! Located at the heart of the city, the SAM at 8Q features a lot of unique, creative and eye-catching contemporary art exhibitions about Singapore. Also, there are several interactive activities that are targeted at kids. So it's a great place for family outing! Be ready to have a fascinating visit to the SAM at 8Q!",5,34,2
158,Although the exhibition hall is small in scale. We really enjoyed visit here.  Singapore Residents and PR It is currently free admission.,4,34,3
159,Great for kids and adults alike with plenty of exhibits that educate and engage. The interactive exhibits are popular. The little cinema on L2 plays short animated films that are rather well made.,5,34,4
160,"8Q Singapore Art Musuem is one of my favourite place in Singapore! With their creative, innovative and interactive installation and art works on display...promising hours of entertainment for the family. I am very grateful for the staffs at the musuem for this wonderful place. Definitely a place to check out constantly!",5,34,5
161,Quiet mosque in the heart of Chinatown. But I realize something. A lot of religion buildings not actively engaging visitors for donation like what temples in Japanese are doing. They sell souvenir n make a roaring biz to support the cause. Sg should adopt the same.,5,35,2
162,"All visitors are welcome. You are expected to open your shoes on the entrance A covering kimono-like robe are provided for women visitor. Its peaceful, and serene. Clean and well maintained. Great place to pray for muslim in chinatown area.",5,35,3
163,"Visitors welcome 10-6  daily, Friday 10-12 & 2:30-6 This mosque, while simple and plain, even for a mosque, has the best signage explaining Islam that I have ever seen.",4,35,4
164,"Jamae mosque was built by the Chulia community.  This Mosque was gazetted as a national monument on 19 November 1974.  It is believed to be the oldest of the five mosques gazetted as national monuments in Singapore.  Located in the Chinatown area.  Very traditional and 'old'.  Staff are super friendly, nice and helpful.  They are happy to answer any questions or explain more about the history of the mosque to you.  They have robes that you can borrow if you are not appropriately dressed.  Highly recommend.",4,35,5
165,"Amid the bustling streets of Singapore’s Chinatown, the Jame Chulia Mosque stands as a reminder of the city’s rich multicultural past. Built in 1826 by Tamil Muslim traders from South India—known as Chulias—this mosque served as a key religious hub for the early Muslim community in colonial Singapore. Its distinct minaret and arched entrance make it one of the oldest mosques in the country, standing as a witness to nearly two centuries of history.  What makes Jame Chulia Mosque even more fascinating is its location along South Bridge Road, where multiple religious landmarks coexist side by side. Just steps away are the Sri Mariamman Temple, Singapore’s oldest Hindu temple, and the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple, an important Buddhist site. This peaceful intermingling of places of worship reflects Singapore’s ethos of religious harmony—where faiths do not compete, but rather complement one another in a shared space. Jame Chulia Mosque continues to serve not only as a place of prayer but as a symbol of how different communities have shaped the nation together.  #ramadan30days30mosques #ramadan #mosque #mosques #ramadanchallenge #islam #muslim #holymonth #tourism #travel #muslimtraveler #bangladeshi #bangladeshitraveller #singapore #jamechulia",4,35,6

168,"Very cool architecture. Keep an eye out for free exhibitions, worth a visit.",5,36,6
169,This is the third time I have visited and the rude woman with thick framed glasses and short hair at the front desk every time has told me there are no exhibitions on and they at re-installing a show!!! So annoying and disappointing!!!! ?,1,36,1
170,"Very good architecture. Keep an eye out for free exhibitions, worth a visit.",5,36,2
171,I’m usually very afraid of heights but this experience made me feel very comfortable and at ease. It’s was an amazing 360 degree view of Singapore and the sites we saw were outstanding. Don’t miss this opportunity on your itinerary.,5,37,2
172,"One of the must visit attractions in Singapore..... It's just too good.... View from the top is mesmerizing one can entire Singapore city, especially Gardens by the bay, Merlion park... It's approximately 45 minutes ride. Highly recommended",5,37,3
173,Had an amazing experience at the Singapore Flyer. I took an evening slot and saw the entire city. It moves slowly which give you the opportunity to experience every corner of the city. I went at around 5:30PM on a weekday and got the entire capsule to myself since there was no queue.  Had a great time there,5,37,4
174,It was a good experience for the good tourist attractions we did during the day and it was good to see Singapore's high rise buildings from the top of the Singapore flyer observation wheel. Another great way to ease the sunny weather of Singapore. First you need to purchase tickets and they accept walk-ins and online purchased tickets. Not crowded we got our own cabin since the time was so perfect and nobody was in the queues. There are a few cafes in the area and restaurants if you feel hungry after you see from above. This is all for all ages and I highly recommend it to everyone have fun ?,5,37,5
175,"The Singapore Flyer is a must-visit! Smooth queue management makes the experience hassle-free, even during peak times. The lively complex around it buzzes with energy, offering dining and shopping options to complement the ride. The Flyer’s massive radius ensures a leisurely, breathtaking journey, with adorable views of Singapore’s skyline, Marina Bay, and beyond. From twinkling city lights to iconic landmarks, the panoramic vistas are unforgettable. Perfect for families, couples, or solo travelers seeking a unique perspective of this vibrant city. Highly recommend timing your ride for sunset!",5,37,6
176,"It was one of the best 5-star experience for me. I enjoyed every bit of the room - all clean down to the last detail. Kudos to the staff of the hotel - cannot thank them enough for the wonderful service. The hotel might have cost a lot but every dollar is worth the price. You get your money's worth when you decide to try and stay at the Marina Bay Sands Hotel. The room is spacious and spotless. The furniture and necessities are modern. I can even praise the shower for having soft water bubbles. The breakfast buffet at the Rise was also enjoyable with lots of options that satisfy. The check in and check out process were seamless and pleasant. Thank you, Marina Bay Sands. My husband and I had the most amazing time.",5,38,4
177,"The most important place in Singapore, a must-see for everyone. I especially enjoyed the nighttime experience. Everyone comes here to watch the light show. There were no crowds, so you could take photos and relax on the waterfront in peace. I highly recommend it. An unforgettable view.",5,38,5
178,"Marina Bay Sands is one of the most stunning places I’ve visited in Singapore. That day I spent time walking around, enjoying the view, and taking photos. The architecture is so iconic and the whole place feels elegant and beautifully designed. Even just strolling along the promenade was relaxing and memorable.  What made the day truly unforgettable was having dinner at the rooftop bar, right at the highest point of the building. The view was absolutely breathtaking. I watched the sunset paint the sky in warm colors, followed by a full moon rising above the city skyline. It was one of those moments that just takes your breath away. Everything felt magical. The atmosphere, the view, the food, the soft breeze,  it all came together perfectly.  Whether you’re staying at the hotel or just visiting, this is a place you should not miss. It’s a must-see in Singapore and a memory I’ll always keep with me.",5,38,6
179,"This luxury hotel in Singapore is a timeless classic that I find myself returning to again and again. No matter how many times I visit, I'm always blown away by its unmatched sense of luxury. Every detail—from the ambiance to the service—is flawlessly refined, creating a truly extraordinary experience. Even when I consider trying other hotels, I somehow always end up back here. If you're looking for a special stay in Singapore, this place is absolutely worth it.",5,38,1
180,A night out in the Casino was a great experience. Very clean with friendly staff. However getting a drink proved somewhat tiresome as have to find a staff member to then order and bring it to you. Blue Pearl Restaurant was nice with lovely food.,5,38,2
181,"A lovely spot to enjoy a few relaxing hours outside. The rooftop green space is ideal for picnicking, flying kites, or simply taking in the fresh air and panoramic city views. It offers a calm, family-friendly atmosphere and a refreshing escape from the hustle and bustle of urban life. More than just its aesthetic appeal, the space also plays an important functional role managing flood risks, preventing seawater intrusion, and serving as a freshwater reservoir to help meet the city’s water demands. It’s truly remarkable how it blends eco-friendly infrastructure with a welcoming public area.",5,39,3
182,"My go to place for a picnic. Perfect place to chill, unwind, catch the sunset, fly kites. Large grassy open space on rooftop with a view of the skyline. Bring your friends, family, pets, kids etc to spend a nice evening. Fully accessible for disabled. No need to reserve or book for groups below 20 pax. Drinking water fountains present.",5,39,4
183,"A spread out vast area with vista of the city, numerous water features and artworks. Unfortunately the sustainability museum was closed, as part of the gardens by the bay setup. An easy walk around without the massive crowd.",4,39,5
184,"Beautiful place to spend a few hours outdoors. The rooftop lawn is perfect for picnics, kite flying, or just enjoying the breeze and city skyline. It’s peaceful, family friendly, and offers a nice break from the busy city.  Beyond its charm, it also serves a practical purpose helping with flood control, keeping seawater out, and creating a freshwater reservoir that supports the city’s water needs. It’s impressive how it combines environmental sustainability with public space.",5,39,6
185,"First time visiting this new (for us) free public space in Singapore. There’s plenty of things to do, like water play, playing kites on top of the building, going to the sustainable gallery, walking and running, and there’s some lizards passing by that so interesting for the western foreigners. Good for healing and education also.",5,39,1
186,"If you are passionate of hiking the area have some trails, for the lazy ones (like me) you can put the bridge on the ridesharing app and it will leave you somewhere under and you climb some stairs until on top. The bridge is interesting and the view is beautiful. If you are lucky you might spot monkeys. We didn’t ?",5,40,3
187,"Henderson Waves is one of my favorite spots in Singapore. The bridge has a unique wave-like design and is actually the highest pedestrian bridge in the country. It’s made of wood and steel, with curved sections where you can sit and enjoy the view, it feels peaceful and blends beautifully with the trees around.  It’s easy to get there by bus, but be ready for a steep staircase to reach the bridge. If you’re coming from Faber Point, the walk takes about 10–15 minutes and offers great views along the way.  The park around it is spacious and quiet, with plenty of shaded benches to rest. The air feels fresh and clean. Just be a bit careful during rainy weather, lightning can happen, so bring an umbrella just in case!",5,40,4
188,"Good :  A wavy bridge providing great pics. A nice trek can lead you there. Unique design.  Bad: No shelter from elements, don't forget umbrellas No restrooms nearby.",4,40,5
189,Amazing scenic place. One of the best views that Singapore can offer. Hike up may be tiring but the view is worth it. Recommended to come early in the morning to catch the sunrise and breathe in the fresh air. The night view is also unparalleled as its height allows for less light pollution. Wildlife here is also abundant for those nature lovers. Close to Faber Peak as well.,5,40,6
190,"Henderson Waves is a must-visit architectural marvel and the highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore, standing 36 meters above ground. Its wave-like wooden structure offers a unique blend of design and nature, connecting Mount Faber Park to Telok Blangah Hill Park. The panoramic views of the city, lush greenery, and sunset are breathtaking. Perfect for a leisurely walk or photo opportunities, especially at night when the bridge is beautifully illuminated. Highly recommended for nature lovers and architecture enthusiasts!  The best times to visit Henderson Waves for the best views are: •	Early Morning: Ideal for tranquility and sunrise views. It’s cooler and less crowded, making it perfect for a peaceful walk. •	Late Afternoon to Sunset: Offers stunning views of the setting sun and the cityscape. The bridge’s illumination begins at 7 PM, adding a romantic ambiance. •	Evening: The bridge is beautifully lit from 7 PM to 7 AM, creating a magical atmosphere. It’s great for photography and evening strolls. Visiting on weekdays can help avoid crowds.",5,40,1
191,"Finally visited Pinnacle @ Duxton after years of admiring it from afar — and it did not disappoint! The 50th-floor Skybridge and Observation Deck offer one of the most breathtaking 360° views of Singapore’s skyline, from Marina Bay to Chinatown’s bustling streets.  What makes this place special? It’s not just an architectural marvel but how visionary public housing can be. The design is modern, the surroundings are vibrant, and the location is unbeatable — steps away from Neil Road’s famous eateries (hello, Michelin Bib Gourmand spots!) and the cultural heart of Chinatown.",5,41,4
192,"Good location and view, cosy and atas design. The corridors give a lot of privacy and yet there's good air-flow. Pity the prices though: They're at the pinnacle of the market.  High-rise living is not for those who have vertigo.",4,41,5
193,"Fantastic view, and not a soul there. Very cheap. Highly recommend",5,41,6
194,Well worth it for $6.  Great view and can walk all around the roof perimeter.  Can see a lot of stuff around,5,41,1
195,"$6, go up from block 1G of pinnacle @ duxton. Pay in cash only at level 1. Look for the small office and bring your ez link card with you. Debit cards and bank cards with ez link function is not allowed. Bring normal netspay or ez link only.  If you walk over from the park you will be at lvl 3 so make sure to take lift to level 1 of block 1G  Views is great. Place is big and able to walk as a park for 1 or 2 hr to chill. Can walk in for these views and not too many people. For the price and view. Totally worth it.  What a nice neighborhood. Very well designed  Check out my sunset video taken here.  Viewing it from the eyes is still the best though. Appreciate the moment there",5,41,2
196,"Hajjah Fatimah Mosque exudes an air of tranquility and serenity, making it a cherished sanctuary for worshippers and visitors alike. Stepping into the mosque, I was struck by its timeless elegance and graceful architecture, which reflects the rich heritage of Islamic culture in Singapore.  The interior exudes a sense of peace and reverence, with intricate arabesque designs adorning the walls and ceilings, and soft light filtering through stained glass windows. As I joined the congregation for Eid prayers, I was enveloped in a sense of spiritual harmony, united in worship with fellow believers from diverse backgrounds.  Hajjah Fatimah Mosque serves as a beacon of faith and community in the heart of Singapore, offering solace and inspiration to all who seek solace within its hallowed halls.",5,42,2
197,"On International Women’s Day, it is only fitting to highlight a mosque built by a woman—Hajjah Fatimah Mosque in Singapore. This historic mosque stands as a testament to the resilience, generosity, and contributions of women in Islamic history. Hajjah Fatimah was a wealthy Malay businesswoman of noble descent who married a Bugis prince. One day, her home was raided and burned down by robbers, but she survived simply because she was not there at the time. In gratitude to Allah for her safety, she donated the land to build a mosque for the Muslim community. Completed in 1846, Hajjah Fatimah Mosque showcases a unique architectural blend of Malay, Chinese, and European influences, with its leaning minaret often compared to the Tower of Pisa.  This mosque serves as a powerful reminder that women have long played vital roles in shaping communities, not only through leadership and trade but also in faith and social service. Islamic history is littered with women who have made a difference—from political leaders and scholars to philanthropists and spiritual figures—leaving a lasting impact on society. Nearly two centuries later, Hajjah Fatimah’s legacy continues through this mosque, standing strong as a symbol of her enduring impact.  #ramadan30days30mosques #ramadan #mosque #mosques #ramadanchallenge #islam #muslim #holymonth #tourism #travel #muslimtraveler #bangladeshi #bangladeshitraveller #internationalwomensday #women #singapore #singaporemuslimah",5,42,3
198,"One of the mosque that is well taken care and the serene feelings once you are inside. However for those who drives, it is a big challenge to park near the mosque, as it is near the hawker centre and busy area.",4,42,4
199,"I had a very great experience praying jummah prayer in this mosque. Would love to go back here, god willing. The sermon was very on point, the congregation are from all kinds and sizes. truly a melting pot.",5,42,5
200,"Interesting history of the mosque that was built by the late businesswomen named Hajjah Fatimah. It was told that the minaret were tilted slightly by 6° in 1975 as it was builty on sandy soil. Restoration works was done to ensure it doesn't tilt any further. Famously known as ""the leaning tower of Singapore"".",5,42,6
201,"☀️ Saturday, 7 June 2025 : A Walk Under the Sun at a Cultural Gem  A sunny day well spent exploring a truly unique and artistic park. This Asian cultural park, originally known as Tiger Balm Garden, was created by the Aw family — the founders of the Tiger Balm brand. It's fascinating to read the stories & beliefs behind each statue and scene they've built.  It's a place where both adults & kids can enjoy a blend of culture, art, and history. You could easily spend around two hours wandering through the thoughtfully designed displays and soaking in the atmosphere.  Entry is free, which makes it even more worth a visit. However, the only downside is that the park isn’t as well-maintained as it deserves to be. Not much shelter.  Pro tips: ? Bring mosquito repellent ? Watch out for red ants in some corners Can bring some handheld fans  Despite those minor issues, it’s a memorable and educational experience — one that leaves a lasting impression.",4,43,4
202,"This beautiful sculpture garden has free admission! It has many detailed sculptures about Buddhist history and stories. You walk toward a statue, turn, and see another on the wall! There are fountains and towers that also captivate you! Please, leave a donation if you can! I was not expecting this place to become my favorite place in Singapore!",5,43,5
203,"The museum isn’t cheap but the information within is so intelligent and tastefully laid out. The free portion is delightful with folklore, endless turtle feeding and inexplicable figures. Spent hours and could have spent more. Loved it.",5,43,6
204,An iconiq theme park from decades ago. I used to visit this during CNY with family when I was little so brought back many memories revisiting the park. There is now a cafe selling snacks and drinks and the hell museum is now a paid feature. Otherwise the park is totally free to visit. The park was built by two brothers and their monuments as well as their parents are within the park. These brothers are also the ones who own Tiger balm cream. The park is very old you can see very nostalgic way of sculpting human figures. A lot of Chinese mythology stories told through the sculptures.,5,43,1
205,"I liked this place so much, I visited it twice. It look almost unrealistic. It feel almost like being in a them park because everything is painted. It's also interesting because you have some explanations for everything piece of art that you are seeing. I recommend it. It's usually really calm and it's easy to access via the bus, the metro or with a grab. You have the park that you can access from free, and then the museum. For the museum you need to pay but you don't have to do it. You can just visit the park. You can see and feed some turtles, it's really fun! I think, if you take your time you can spend at least 1hour in the park",5,43,2
206,"This is a beautifully conserved heritage building. All visits are by appointment only. Tours from Tuesdays to Fridays at 10am and on Saturdays at 10am and 2pm. Tickets cost $5-18++. It is a pity that no photography is allowed inside the building. Ironically, the person in charge of welcoming visitors at the door wasn’t welcoming at all. This middle aged man might be the Donald mentioned by past reviewers.",3,44,3
207,Need to prebook in advance & ticketed place. No photography allowed indoor so can only take photos of the exterior. Guided 1 hour tour. Very informative on the Peranakan culture.,3,44,4
208,"House is good, but guide can improved a bit. Not to compare with other local Paranankan house museums (like Penang or Malacca), the Chinese reference have some error or can’t differentiate between general Chinese and Hokkien heritage of its own… good but not satisfied.",4,44,5
209,"I should have given 5 stars, as this is incredibly beautiful little building, but I was so disappointed to learn, that you can’t visit it anymore. Such a shame!",4,44,6
210,"This museum is owned by NUS. We had a docent tour by Audrey who provided interesting accounts of the Peranakan way of life and knowledgeable insights. While no pictures are allowed inside the house, you can take pictures outside. There is an elevator for those with mobility issues, to access the second floor. There are also some well preserved artifacts in the house and I like how this living museum is also used as a research centre for NUS architecture students.",5,44,1
211,Beautiful and lovely Chinese temple with a long history of tradition. It’s commonly known as 水廊头 in the older days. You can bring your parents to learn more about the deities and temple.  Located inside Lam Ann Building. Walk up the flight of stairs to get to 鳳山寺。,4,45,4
212,"I have been to many temples in Singapore but when I came to this hidden temple I felt so peaceful. It was so clean, the uncle was so friendly. He taught us how to worship correctly way. I like the quietness and the history of the saint here. This is a place of faith and peace for you to visit when you need to calm down yourself..",5,45,5
213,A hidden gem. I think such temples near tourist location should be better promoted. English translation and signs should be installed to guide tourists. Small Buddhism items can even be sold for donations. Should learn like japanese temple. Heritage board should assist to uplift such historical monuments in SG.,5,45,6
214,"It’s a cool place for tourists! This temple is hiding in the city center, so it’s quite easy for you to find it. It’s a good place for you to learn how Singaporeans pray I’ve never seen those type of incense and bei (杯）before. You also get to make your own blessing charm (need to put the ashes into the bag by yourself) Very very cool experience.  The temple is super clean, uncle is super friendly, I’ve learned a lot about the history of the temple, the way to pray and the story of the god.  Worth to visit!",5,45,1
215,"Yesterday, while attending the Nan'an Cultural Festival, I stumbled upon the majestic Fengshan Temple. In that moment, I realized that I also share ancestral ties with Nan'an. Despite my past ventures near Mohamad Sultan Road, I had never ventured into the seemingly inaccessible Fengshan Temple perched atop the hill. However, yesterday's encounter filled me with a sense of rediscovery and reconnection. It was a delightful surprise that allowed me to reclaim something lost, and I am truly grateful for this newfound bond and humbled by my past ignorance of the rich Min-nan architecture locally. #LostAndFound #FengshanTemple #NanAnCulturalFestival #RediscoveringRoots #AncestralTies #CulturalConnection",5,45,2
216,"This is wonderful, deep museum, a must see for people with an interest in history. It costs S€25, which if you are like me, and want to learn about history and local culture in a new place you visit, is totally worth it. I’ll always remember my experience in this museum, for the ethnic Chinese that came to Singapore since the early 19th century, and the evolution of Singapore history and economic development. Also, thank you to the woman 老板 on the front desk for being so nice to talk to.",5,46,4
217,Attended the charity walk at NTU in front of the Chinese heritage centre organised by Hokkien Huay Kuan .,5,46,5
218,"Good museum, but very strange way of going into exhibition: you need to leave 50 sgd deposit in cash (even you can buy tickets only strictly online) and then they give you an electronic card/key to open door to the exhibition. Unbelievable combo for 21 century:)",4,46,6
219,One of the best kept secrets Heritage sites in Singapore. This used to be the administrative building for Nanyang University when it was builder back in 1955. This magnificent building retains its majestic look over the years and serves as a bridge between Nanyang University and the current NTU. Lesser known fact was Queen Elizabeth visited this building as part of her state visit in 1972,5,46,1
220,"The museum is very interesting and we had a great moment.  Kids loved, had a great fun learning about the Chinese journey to Singapore.  I recommend 100%.",5,46,2
221,Brilliant place to consider upon what art is for ordinary people like us.,5,48,1
222,Located at Gillman Barack's the NTU center for contemporary art showcases more experimental and research based works than the other venues on the site.,3,48,2
223,Really interesting and thought provoking exhibition. There is also a separate room with books for background reading on the ideas.,5,48,3
224,A bit difficult to go in if one has not been to the place before. To go there is by a side path,4,48,4
225,I enjoyed the space and long form videos.. full movies in length really. And multiple spaces allows you to spend a few hours very easily.,5,48,5
226,I came here because I was attracted by the reviews. It was a small museum where you can admire diverse gadgets or bags or decorations. Most of them executed in a very creative way. They also presented a lot of revolutionary tools in medicine especially. It is an interesting museum to see. I liked it.,5,49,1
227,"This is a quick and inexpensive museum.  Don't expect too much here, but it is interesting.  Hopefully, some of the products they display will be available someday.  They give you a discount for the store with ticket purchase.",5,49,2
228,It's a small museum. The permanent collection felt like ‘slightly interesting’ creations rather than futuristic/innovative inventions. The exhibition of the new competition is a bit better.,3,49,3
229,"Red Dot Design Museum stands as a vibrant celebration of innovation and creativity, offering visitors a unique window into the world of cutting-edge design. As soon as you step into the museum, you are greeted by a dynamic space that showcases an impressive array of products, concepts, and installations from top designers around the globe.  The museum’s curated exhibits are a visual delight, featuring an extensive collection of designs that span various industries—from consumer electronics and furniture to transportation and lifestyle products. Each display highlights the thought, precision, and artistic vision behind every design, inviting you to appreciate the innovation and functionality that form the core of great design philosophy.",5,49,4
230,"Really great design museum, lots of inspiring designs and methods on showcase with fun activities on each floor. Covered everything from product design, advances in manufacturing, innovative architectural designs and furniture. There was a lot of AI related work which I'm not a fan of, but that just seems to be the way the industry is going, so not really a flaw of the museum",5,49,5
231,"Visited on a Wednesday morning and it was a relaxing trip with interesting artworks and interactive areas (newspaper cutting for wall mural, stickers and letter writing for children) in the 3 exhibitions. Cozy cafe outside the exhibition hall. Free admission for locals. Took the lift up to level 3 at lobby B for 1 of the exhibitions.",5,50,3
232,"Wow, what a wonderful gallery. When we visited there was a combination of art from the permanent collection as well as some amazing temporary shows. Staff welcoming and helpful. Food vending machines available. A must visit for anyone who is interested in contemporary art. We caught the bus which was very convenient - if coming from Civic keep walking once you get off the bus, and then go through the pedestrian gate - once through the gate the sign posting improves.",5,50,4
233,"Free admission for local.  When I visited, only two galleries were open while the others were closed. Still, I really enjoyed the experience—many of the artworks were creative and thought-provoking. Singapore could definitely use more art spaces like this to inspire and support local creativity.",4,50,5
234,"Interesting place! Of my xxth years in SG, I did not realise that there is a museum at such an unassuming place. It has interesting pieces being displayed - worth visiting. I was interested in the collection of books they had at the lobby. Unfortunately, it's not for sale, but you can always pick it up and read on premises. Will be back as I did not get the full experiences as we went there during PH, whereas some places are closed. in addition, some sections of the museum were closed for refreshing their collections.",5,50,6
235,It’s new and still not that well known so we were the only one there. Most of the exhibitions are still a work in progress so I recommend going there a bit later in the year to make sure you experience your money worth.,3,50,1
236,Love the design center. Always an experience. They have the Desa Potato exhibition but on the last week already. A cool showcase of how to reduce waste and uplift.,5,51,5
237,"Visited National Design Centre and had a great experience! I happened to come during the UNIQLO Spring/Summer 2025 pop-up booth, which was a fantastic showcase of their latest collection. The space was well-organized, and the setup blended seamlessly with the centre’s creative and modern atmosphere.  A special highlight was visiting on Valentine’s Day, where I received a flower while wearing a UNIQLO product—such a nice surprise that added a thoughtful touch to the event! The overall vibe of the space is inspiring, making it a great place to explore design, fashion, and creativity.  Definitely a must-visit for those who appreciate art, design, and unique pop-up events in Singapore! Looking forward to returning for more exhibitions and special showcases in the future.",5,51,6
238,Very interesting installation at the National Design Centre! The creative works on display are truly impressive.,5,51,1
239,Nothing is possible exhibition. I will like to extend my greatest appreciation to the artist and workers. What a huge project it is. Hope the message is clearly disseminate to those who attend the exhibition.,5,51,2
240,"Classic art deco building with a simple large space interior that has various rotating shows, so it's worth checking back to see what's on. Also wonderful Tanuki Raw Cafe, bookshop, and unique goods clothing and accessory store.",5,51,3
241,"Arrive early to explore the surrounding Victoria Theatre and Empress Lawn, or take a walk by the Singapore River. Nearby cafes and restaurants also make it easy to enjoy a full night out. Overall Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5) A truly enriching venue that combines cultural heritage with exceptional musical experiences. Whether you’re attending your first concert or you’re a seasoned music lover, Victoria Concert Hall offers a memorable night out in Singapore.",5,52,4
242,"Against all odds, I was impressed  Look, I’m not exactly the “classical music” type. I used to think it was all a bit stuffy—people in black, playing long sad notes, lots of bowing. I’ve always been more of a casual listener (if that), and I definitely didn’t grow up going to concert halls. But something shifted.  I watched my first full choral concert here a while back—a performance by the Voices of Singapore Ladies’ Choir. I didn’t expect much. I thought I’d be bored. Instead, I sat there, completely taken in. The harmonies, the precision, the way the sound filled the room—it got to me. I didn’t know music could feel that human and that powerful.  More recently, I actually performed here with the Singapore Symphony Chorus for Choral Encounters. Standing on that stage felt surreal. The acoustics are no joke—everything you sing comes back to you clean and balanced. It’s not flashy or high-tech, but it works. You don’t have to push; the hall does a lot of the work.  The venue itself is old-school, but in a good way. Built in 1905, restored nicely. Not huge, not small—just right. It’s right in the city centre, next to the river and some museums. Easy to get to. Comfortable seating, good visibility, nothing to complain about.  I came in a skeptic and left feeling… moved? Changed, even. Classical music isn’t just for other people. This place helped me realise that.  So yeah—five stars. Didn’t expect to say that, but here we are.",5,52,5
243,"We’ve been coming here several times over the years. Beautiful concert hall with colonial-era architecture. It’s an old historical building but very well-maintained. Comfortable seatings and good air-conditioning. Friendly and helpful staff. Dress standard is pretty relaxed. I’ve seen people in tuxedos as well as in t-shirts & shorts. Within walking distance from City Hall and Raffles Place MRT stations but not sheltered all the way so an umbrella is needed when raining. No F&B outlets on premises for commoners like us, only one super fancy restaurant. But Funan is about 10-minute walk away.",5,52,6
244,"? Victoria CONCERT HALL ➡️ 11 Empress Place, #01-02, Singapore 179558  ? Victoria Concert Hall was originally built in 1905 as the Victoria Memorial Hall and it formed one half of the twin complex.  ? It was renamed ""Victoria Concert Hall"" in 1979 when it became the Singapore Symphony Orchestra’s ( SSO) home, replacing the original Town Hall auditorium.  ? It underwent a SGD158 million restoration from 2010 to 2014, carefully conserving the neo-classical façade, re-instating original courtyard passageways, and other heritage elements.  --------------------------------  ? Acoustics & Hall Layout ***************************** ? The main concert hall seats a total of 673 patrons:  ? 538 in the sloping stalls seats and 135 in a compact Upper Level Circle balcony.  ? The vast concert stage area serves as a platform for both orchestra, piano and organ performances.  ? Victoria Concert Hall also boasts Singapore’s only fully mechanical 2,012-pipe Klais organ ( ➡️ installed in 1987),  which adds majestic resonance to performances. ___________________________________  ? Interior & Ambience *************************** ? The post-renovation atrium ➡️ a glass-roofed, light-filled space connecting both Victoria theatre and hall—creates a bright, welcoming mid‑performance interlude.  ? Interior pillars and ornate moldings were restored by craftsmen from South India, revealing the original grandeur.  ? Lighting and material choices blend classical and modern: ➡️ gold-toned stainless fixtures, and warm-cream-shade upholstery evoke a luxurious and refined feel. ____________________________________  ?Visitor Experience *********************** ?  There are 3 main audience levels: ground-level sloping stalls, first-floor Circle, and the elegant foyer / atrium area enhancing both visual and social appeal.  ?  The hall feels intimate and acoustically precise ➡️ a great match for chamber music, orchestral recitals, and organ performances.  ?  To me, Victorial Concert Hall is a heritage space where heritage meets contemporary event comfort.  ? This was where my late foster Baba Peranakan father would bring me to watch concert performances at times when I was a small child.  ? So the memories I have of this place are deeply embedded in the labyrinths of my mind.",5,52,1
245,"Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall is a beautiful collage of heritage and modernity. From the outside it looks like a gorgeous neoclassical architecture but inside is pretty much a modern building.  Around the Hall are parks and museums and if you’re tourist like me, strolling around the grounds and taking photos is a must! In the background are some of Singapore’s iconic buildings.  If you’re walking during a sunny day though, be sure to put on sunscreen, and a hat for extra sun protection - especially during summer.",5,52,2
246,"I recently visited the NUS Museum and was absolutely fascinated by its collection focused on animals and natural history. One of the highlights was seeing the impressive dinosaur bones and massive whale skeleton, which offered a real sense of scale and history that photos simply can’t capture.  The museum features countless specimens that showcase the incredible diversity of the animal kingdom. From preserved insects and reptiles to birds and marine creatures, each display taught me something new about how different species evolved and adapted to their environments. It was amazing to learn how animals are all interconnected and how their evolutionary paths reflect broader changes in the world around them.  The exhibits do a fantastic job explaining complex topics like natural selection, extinction, and ecological balance in an engaging and easy-to-understand way. I left with a deeper appreciation of the delicate harmony in nature and how humans fit into the story of evolution.  I highly recommend booking tickets in advance to have enough time to explore every section without rushing. Overall, it was an eye-opening and enriching visit — perfect for anyone curious about how life on Earth has developed and continues to change over millions of years.",5,53,5
247,"It's free and it's just opposite of Natural history museum. We can be sure to find Ancient Chinese pots, earthenware, ceramics. There are few artifacts from India and one from combodia. There are some paintings and art installation. A few crazy things were there in sculptures and art. Otherwise simple, neat museum which you can cover in a couple of hours",4,53,6
248,"Nice place, very kind staff, free ticket. Thank you for the hospitality",5,53,1
249,"Entry to the museum is free but depending on the crowd outside you could be waiting up to 30 minutes to get in. Upon entering, the staff will give you a briefing on what you can and cannot do inside of the building. There are three levels. The first and third floors being dedicated to pottery of different time periods. The second floor is more for temporary exhibits and more exploratory things. The exhibits on this floor could use more explanation instead of a number next to such exhibits, as I had a hard time understanding why it was even displayed in the beginning. Overall a good place to visit if you happen to be within a stones throw from here.",4,53,2
250,"NUS Museum is a university museum focused on Asian art and culture, with a mix of historical and contemporary works. The space is nothing grand but large enough to house a good range of exhibits, and very comfortable — calm, quiet, and peaceful when I visited, perfect for a slow, reflective visit.  The permanent collection is well-curated, and they currently have two excellent exhibitions: Fistful of Colours: Moments of Chinese Cosmopolitanism and Unfettered Brush: The Art and Writings of Tan Joo Jong — both worth checking out.  Overall, a hidden gem if you enjoy art and want a quiet museum experience.",4,53,3
251,"Sun Yat Sen Nanyang Memorial Hall is a historical site dedicated to the life and legacy of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. The museum showcases his contributions to the revolution, with exhibits highlighting Singapore's role in modern Chinese history.",5,54,5
252,"? I have been here twice to this Sun Yat Sun Memorial Hall. ● Once, in the mid 1970s, when I was a small child, my biological mum took me here.  ➡️ Back then, the Memorial Hall was very dilapidated.  ✅️ Now, it is beautifully restored.  ? As I live nearby in Toa Payoh East, we would sometimes go to Balestier Road, and would pass by Ah Hood Road, and pass by this Sun Yat Sen house.  ? I am super faniliar with this area, because as a child born in mid-1960s, my foster Baba Peranakan family lived at Jalan Ampas ( ➡️ off Balestier Road) and I grew up here before we all moved to Toa Payoh East, just across the large canal.  ? The museum memorial hall is nicely done up. ● It has tons of memorial artefacts & many of the vintage pics reminds me of my 1960s childhood era.  I still pass by this 孙中山 hall from time to time.  ?  This mansion memorial hall is truly worth a visit. ✨️?Please come and learn about the history here. It is a deeply educational and informative experience.",5,54,6
253,"Well maintained with many different activities and events happening through the year. The gallery and exhibits depicts the deep history of many significant personas along Dr Sun. Great place for chinese cultural roots immersion and festivals, esp. for kids who always get to participate various workshops and fun learning.",4,54,1
254,"Interesting and quite informative!  Free for Singaporeans and PR 8 $ for expats ( EP, DP) and 5$ for students studying in Singapore  Guided english tour available at 2pm  The staff are cordial and have a pleasant personality.  Well maintained premises including the garden.  Worth it! We spent a good 2.5 hours exploring the 2 floors on a Thursday afternoon.",5,54,2
255,"The Sun Yat Sen Memorial Hall poignantly celebrates the legacy of Sun Yat Sen, the Founding Father of the Republic of China. This museum not only honors his brief stay in Singapore and his efforts to rally support against the Qing Dynasty but also showcases the generous contributions of local Chinese merchants to his cause. A revealing glimpse into a time when the Chinese diaspora in British-ruled Singapore played a pivotal role in China's fight for independence.  Audio guide: check the schedule. They had a specific time slot only.",5,54,3
256,"I visited the Asian Civilisations Museum on a Sunday at 10:15 AM and was pleasantly surprised to find no queue. We waited around 40 minutes for the guided tour at 11:00 AM, which I highly recommend. The one-hour tour provides deeper insight into key artifacts and also highlights lesser-known pieces with fascinating stories that are easy to overlook.  The museum spans three levels, and you could easily spend an entire day exploring its exhibitions. If you don’t plan to dine at the museum restaurant, consider bringing some snacks or takeaways. The displays cover a wide range of Asian civilizations. They offer a rich perspective on Asian history through trade, art, and cultural exchanges.  Amenities include free lockers, charging ports with locks, and water dispensers. There is also a children’s section, but note that all visitors are required to wear socks, so plan accordingly if you're bringing kids.  One area that could be improved is the navigation within the museum. I found it a bit confusing to figure out where each exhibition starts and how to move through the different exhibitions.  Overall, I highly recommend a visit to the Asian Civilisations Museum for anyone interested in learning more about Asia’s rich and diverse heritage.",5,55,4
257,"The museum is very beautiful and interesting. They have volunteers that do guided tours and they are for free (included in the ticket). The point is, if you want you can spend the day there and attend all guided tours available. We only had one, and it started from the top floor. She told us about ceramics, ways of crafting them and how they changed over time. The vessels and the meaning of the paintings done on them. Then we continued to fabrics and jewelry - the guide was very passionate and told us the stories in a very pleasant manner.",5,55,5
258,Smartly curated museum with a overall presentation of Southeast Asian art. The gallery on beliefs includes several exhibitions of religious artifacts. There are two restaurants for a quick bite. Perfect place to visit during the hottest hours.,5,55,6
259,"Asian Civilisations Museum is a great place to escape Singapore’s sweltering heat! If you need to cool down after walking along the Singapore river, do come in for a quick air-condition session. The exhibits are nicely done and there’s quite a bit of History to learn here. Museum enthusiasts should and must visit this place!",5,55,1
260,"The pace of the Asian Civilizations Museum makes it stand out from other museums. There is a calm serenity in the space - an opportunity to read and admire the artifacts without feeling rushed or out of breath trying to get through everything there is to see. There is much to explore, and yet there is space to take it in. The music room on the 2nd floor is serene in the sounds and the lighting. There is a kids play area on the first floor - children and adults must wear socks to enter.",5,55,2
261,"You can't go wrong with National Museum of Singapore, highly curated to share the history of the island state with great information.  If you are a history buff or just a visitor.  I am sure you will learn a thing or two after your trip here.  Tips: always look out for their special exhibition that they usually put on once in a while during special occasion. This time it's LEGO.  Hope you enjoy your trip here.",5,56,5
262,"No regrets spending about three hours at the National Museum. We started with the LEGO exhibit and were truly impressed by the intricately crafted models built around the SG60 theme, which celebrates Singapore’s 60 years of nationhood. The exhibit beautifully captured iconic landmarks, historical moments, and everyday scenes that reflect how far the country has come since its early days. It was a refreshing way to revisit our history lessons from school and appreciate the transformation of Singapore into a thriving global city.  The entire experience was enriching and thoughtfully curated to connect visitors to the nation’s past and present. The museum also made the visit interactive and engaging by incorporating games — visitors could complete challenges and record their answers using a wrist tag, an innovative idea that kept everyone motivated to explore more. It’s an experience I highly recommend.  Redeeming tickets was generally user-friendly, but there was no clear instruction that you need to reach inside the collection box to retrieve your printed tickets. We waited for a while, thinking they would automatically appear in front of us, until a helpful volunteer came to our aid before we held up the queue.  Other than that small hiccup, everything was satisfying. This worthwhile exhibition proves that seeing truly is believing — a must-visit for anyone who wants to experience Singapore’s story in a unique and memorable way.",5,56,6
263,"We had a fantastic day exploring Singapore's rich history at the National Museum of Singapore. From its humble beginnings as a small fishing village to its current status as a thriving nation, the exhibits were engaging and informative. My child thoroughly enjoyed the interactive displays and was constantly asking thoughtful questions. A wonderful experience for the whole family!",5,56,1
264,"Amazing museum, so we'll paced, lots of information, I learned so much about Singapore having known almost nothing beforehand. A little expensive as a foreign tourist (25$, approximately €16) but honestly worth it if you enjoy learning history and culture. The park outside is also stunning with even more historical marks that mean even more once you get some historical context from the museum. Very friendly and helpful staff as well.",5,56,2
265,"Visited the National Museum of Singapore and really enjoyed the experience. The exhibits were engaging, and I loved how history was brought to life through multimedia and design. Still feel like there’s more to explore—definitely planning to go back again soon.",4,56,3
266,"Visited the Japanese Cemetery Park and was struck by how peaceful and beautiful it was. The pink flowering archways and quiet paths make it feel like a hidden sanctuary. It’s a respectful, serene place to reflect and appreciate a piece of history. Definitely worth a visit for a calm walk and quiet moment.",4,57,1
267,"A hidden gem in Singapore, this park is incredibly serene and well-maintained. Rows of neatly arranged tombstones create a quiet, respectful atmosphere that’s perfect for a light hike.  Visited on a cloudy day, the place remained clean and peaceful, with hardly any visitors around.  Pop in your earbuds and take in the tranquility. It's a calming escape from the city’s usual pace.",5,57,2
268,"Calm and relaxing space. Although it is quite far away from the city center, I still am happy to have visited there. Unfortunately the praying room was closed though.",4,57,3

Erected in 1850, this Dalhousie Obelisk is a significant historical monument is Singapore's first public monument, commemorating Lord Dalhousie's visit and symbolizing free trade. Its intricate carvings and neoclassical design, rendered in granite, showcase the artistry of its era. Given its proximity to other major cultural sites like the Asian Civilisations Museum and the Victoria Concert Hall, it's an ideal and convenient stop for a full day of cultural exploration.",4,58,6
272,"Tucked away in a quieter corner of Singapore’s historical district, the Dalhousie Obelisk stands as a subtle yet evocative reminder of the city’s colonial past. While not as prominently showcased as some of Singapore’s larger landmarks, this modest monument offers a unique glimpse into history for those willing to seek it out.  Historical Significance and Atmosphere The Dalhousie Obelisk, with its clean, slender lines and understated elegance, carries the air of a bygone era. Erected as a marker of colonial heritage, it invites visitors to pause and reflect on the early days of Singapore’s transformation from a trading post to a modern metropolis. The monument’s inscriptions and design speak quietly of the figures and events that shaped its historical context, making it a fascinating subject for history enthusiasts.",5,58,1
273,You cannot miss it. Great place to chill out. Put it on your trip - you can take a rest in available chair in around. Take a pictures with a glass ball- such a great reflection photo.,5,58,2
274,"Saw this in March before the Singapore Shutdown. This monument was raised to mark the visit of James Andrew Broun-Ramsay. A colonial administrator in British India who rose to become Governor-General of India. This obelisk was raised by the Chinese and Malay citizens of Singapore to mark his visit in 1850, so it's called the Dalhousie Obelisk as he was also the 1st Marquess Dalhousie. Not a must see, but it’s a of a landmark in Boat Quay.",3,58,3
275,Nice obelisk with a sign telling of its origin,5,58,4
276,I visited the Statue of Sir Stamford Raffles in Singapore. It’s an iconic landmark with a classic design that honors the city’s founder—great for a quick history stop and photos.,5,59,1
277,A statue of Sir Stamford Raffles. There is a plaque stating abt his arrival and much more. A nice place to visit overall if u r history fan who just wants a quick journey to see all the historical sights at the Singapore river.,5,59,2
278,"That's the Raffles landing site he first landed and signed the treaty with Johor Sultan that founded Singapore for British. I feel the statue is too whitish! ?? Should have multi colors with our modern times' trend. Singapore is conservative, and should have perhaps used the Raffles landing site as an arts street for artist competitions or for free flea market selling art work. It shouldn't be that empty all day everyday ?? I'm offering FREE tour guiding to anyone touring Singapore as a practice for my upcoming final assessment as tour guide. Please call me NOW!!",3,59,3
279,A history place where modern era of Singapore began.,5,59,4
280,"The statue of Sir Stamford Raffles in Singapore is an iconic symbol of the city's history. As a prominent figure in the island's colonial past, the statue stands tall and majestic, commemorating his role in shaping Singapore's development. Located at Raffles Landing Site, the statue serves as a reminder of the nation's heritage and the enduring legacy of its founder.",5,59,5
281,"It's an extremely well-curated museum with interactive exhibits that toddlers would enjoy. It's a fun way to introduce Singapore's history in a hands-on and engaging manner. I had to explain to my son what a public payphone was for and what all the Milo tins hanging from stalls were about.  Would recommend to plan ahead and book a slot in advance. They reset and clean the areas between each slot, so parents can also feel safe. It's free for Singaporeans.  A word of caution though: the QR code ticket expires after 10 min from the allocated time slot and you will have to join the line for those without advance booking, so arrive early or on time.",5,60,3
282,"My kid had so much fun here, and I would definitely bring him back again. There’s a lot of stuff to keep young kids entertained for a while. Singaporeans get free entry!",5,60,4
283,"It seems we visit every 6 months. We first visited in Jan 2024, then Oct and then yesterday May 2025. The photos show our girls growing up with the museum ?  They particularly enjoy the food play area with the soft cushions and pretend food.  We'll definitely visit more often! Thanks for the fun",5,60,5
284,Bought tickets in advance and managed to add more tickets on the spot due to last minute family joining. Great place for children to learn about history. Friendly staff. There’s a separate play space for ages 4 and below. Parking spots nearby have no shelter.,5,60,6
285,"Area for the babies is great except for how noisy the entire place is because the rest of the space with the older kids is quite open and the sounds echo all over. Nursing room and baby changing area is also downstairs while the baby area is upstairs so that’s a huge hassle, but the facilities are nice in there.",3,60,1
286,"A well designed, informative museum about the short history of the Japanese occupation of Singapore after the feeble British collapse. The exhibits are housed in the original art deco construct of the former frontage of the factory that was preserved. It is thoughtfully designed and of high quality. If you take your time, it could take about an hour+ to slowly digest all the information. Locals and tourists will find it a stimulating & a sobering reminder of the horrors of war, politics, power & the evil that men do. Lest we forget that there are no winners in war, only losers. A sweet and short lesson in history that's been well put together. Highly recommended. Tickets are free for residents & $7 for tourists. Parking is available onsite but limited to less than 30 lots. The bus stop is nearby, a short 5 min walk. About 10 min walk from the Rail Mall.",5,61,4
287,"The Former Ford Factory is a historically significant museum in Singapore, marking the site of the British surrender to the Japanese in 1942. Its ""Surviving the Japanese Occupation: War and its Legacies"" exhibition offers a powerful and comprehensive account of this period through diverse perspectives, including recreated scenes, personal stories, and archival materials.  It's a poignant and educational experience, highly recommended for understanding Singapore's wartime history. Admission is free for Singapore citizens and PRs; foreign visitors pay S$7.13.",4,61,5
288,"Good: Quite a bit of information about WW2, a lot more detailed than what Singaporeans learned in school. Interactive exhibits.  A highlight was to be in the room where the signatures for British surrender of Singapore to Japan.  Not great: Not easy to get to by public transport.  Verdict: If you're a history buff looking for a little more oomph, the is good. Otherwise, go once just to understand a little more of what happened then.",4,61,6
289,"Located within a 5-10min walk from the newly openly Hume MRT station (DTL), this is easily a good visit to take in some historical knowledge or a visit to remind us of post, during and pre war world II. No ticketing required for Singaporeans and PR, just have to show them some identification such as Singpass or IC.  The exhibition is neatly organised from pre/during and post world war II, with archives and summarised description easily understood. Depending on how much time you spend to look on each items/archives, a round look could take anywhere 30 minutes to as much as a few hours. Toilets are also very clean in this facility. In addition, staff behind the counter was very helpful, kind and direct us to the respective exhibits.",5,61,1
290,"A place of historic significance for Singapore about the Second World War.  The place is well preserved and maintained. Another place to learn about Singapore's history. They have some rare historic documents like current notes, maps dating back centuries, magazines, and newspaper clippings etc.",4,61,2

292,"Singapore City Gallery is a must-visit destination for anyone interested in understanding the vision and evolution of Singapore’s urban landscape. As a city planning museum, it offers an engaging, educational, and interactive experience that brings the intricacies of Singapore’s development to life.  At the heart of the gallery is an impressive collection of exhibits that showcase the planning, design, and transformation of the city. Detailed models, high-resolution maps, and dynamic digital displays illustrate how Singapore’s urban planners have masterfully integrated elements of sustainability, functionality, and aesthetics over the decades.

One of the standout features of Singapore City Gallery is its interactive setup. Visitors can engage with touch screens and digital simulations that allow for a hands-on exploration of city planning challenges and solutions. This interactive approach not only makes the learning experience enjoyable but also provides insight into the thoughtful decision-making processes behind the city’s continuous evolution.",5,62,3
293,"This is an underrated free thing to do in Singapore, especially if you're an engineer, interested in city planning, and history buffs. This place is really interesting! You can learn some cool stuff about how Singapore came to be, see how efficient it is, and even peek at its plans for the future.",5,62,4

296,"Small museum and chapel in quiet suburbia near the airport. We traveled by train and bus from Little India. A bus stop is conveniently located in front of museum.  We booked in advance online a tour guide (a must). The tour went for an hour and our tour guide Karen was very professional and engaging throughout our time with her.  The museum is laid out very well and has a lot of information and displays to see. Very educational information to read and watch. A sobering morning learning about the conditions of the POWs and civilians incarcerated during this time. Our guide also spoke about the prisoners order to leave Changi to go to work on the Burma Railway.  There isn’t much to see outside of the museum - a few sign boards. There is a cafe on site (next to museum), serving lunch and also beers.",5,63,3
297,It's a very low key war memorial. The facility was great with a small museum. There is a robot guide with takes you through which is great. There is a water fountain and a locker.  There is a Cafe there which was closed at the moment. You can get there by a public bus easily and is not far from the airport. I found the facility not showing the reality of the history unfortunately. The entry is $8 for adults and $5 for kids.,4,63,4
298,The museum is small but it is jam packed with information. It took us about an hour to work our way through.  If you are lucky enough they have a little robot who guides you through the museum - which gives a more personal perspective in comparison to the displays in the museum.  Easy to get to via public transport from the city.,5,63,5
299,A interesting place to visit. But the exhibition curating can improve a bit: too much text and touch to read rather than to experience….,4,63,6
300,Well worth a visit if you're into history and culture. It was a very moving experience,4,63,1
301,Small but impactful 5-floor exhibition on toys from so many perspectives. I appreciate the effort to make the experience interactive and memorable. Highly recommend for anyone who want to heal their inner child. I had so much fun.,5,64,3
302,"Honestly I went down without any high expectations but this museum of toys surprised me. My kids loved that there was at least one activity on every level (6 levels, including at rooftop). The museum is well maintained and clean. I had no issues for my kids to sit around, yes even on the floor. But do note that the entrance ticket is abit pricey, imo. It is $30 for every adult. Senior above 65 pays $20 and kids below 6 enter for free.",5,64,4
303,"Very nostalgic and peaceful! There were some interactive sections, fun for kids and adults.",4,64,5
304,"Very disappointed, to say the least. Tiny and strangely selected display of some, just some toys, very foreigner-unfriendly payment system, excessive entry price totally unrelated to exhibition size and quality. Not recommended to visit, unless you maybe are writing a scientific thesis on toy-related subject.",1,64,6
305,"Visited MINT to watch a screening of ""Buck Rogers in the 25th Century"", a vintage scifi film I've always known about but was never able to track down and watch. The Museum curated a collection of toys and memorabilia from the era which paired really well with the look and feel of the movie itself. The ambience at MINT is exceptional and the Museum exhibitions bear all the marks of something hand-picked and scrutinised with excellent attention to detail.  The room where the movie was screened was spacious yet cozy, with very comfortable seating and cool air-conditioning throughout the space. It felt unique from the experience of a regular movie theatre, since the room doesn't get as dark it feels more like a communal viewing experience to be shared with friends and family, and you're able to glance around the displays within the room (which were curated to match the movie) if ever you find your eyes or attention wandering.  Overall my trip to the MINT museum was an extremely enjoyable one, the space is lovely and extremely well cared for. It's definitely surprising the value they are able to squeeze out of the space they occupy, it is not only comparable to larger exhibitions at larger venues, I'd argue it is greater in value because of the density and attention they provide towards their displays. There isn't any inch wasted with hastily installed attractions, every little detail is meticulously thought of, and you feel that detail instantly when you begin exploring the spaces.  Definitely would recommend other Singaporeans to visit and take note of this very unique part of our local arts/entertainment scene. And tourists should also take the time to visit, you might be surprised at some of the artifacts that reside in Singapore.",5,64,1
306,"Passed by the Lim Bo Seng Memorial in Esplanade Park today, a poignant reminder of the courage and sacrifice of Major-General Lim Bo Seng during WWII. This memorial honors his bravery in resisting the Japanese Occupation and his dedication to Singapore's freedom. A peaceful spot to reflect on the legacy of our war heroes.",5,65,5
307,"Lim Bo Seng Memorial - A dedicated tribute to Lim Bo Seng, who died during the Japanese Occupation period in 1944. He was held captive by the Japanese Secret Police in Ipoh after a spy identified him as a member of the resistance army.  Designed by Ng Keng Siang, one of Singapore's pioneer local architects to graduate from London, the memorial occupies a site measuring 100 ft by 80 ft (30 m by 24 m), which was donated by the government.  The construction cost of $50,000 was funded by donations from the Chinese community. The memorial takes the form of a 3.6-metre-high octagonal pagoda made of bronze, concrete and marble. A bronze three-tier roof caps the pagoda, while four bronze lions stand guard at the base. Four bronze plaques placed around the pagoda give an account of Lim’s life in English, Chinese, Tamil and Jawi (Malay). On 28 December 2010, the Lim Bo Seng Memorial was gazetted as a national monument.  In 1946, the Lim Bo Seng Memorial Committee, which included representatives from the Chinese Nationalist government, was established to raise funds for the construction of a public memorial dedicated to Lim. The colonial government rejected the committee’s proposal to build a memorial park around his grave, but granted permission for a memorial to be built at the Esplanade. The British Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia at the time, Malcolm MacDonald, laid the foundation stone for the structure on 3 November 1953. The completed memorial was unveiled on 29 June 1954 by Charles Loewen, then commander-in-chief of the Far East Land Forces.  To note: After the war, Lim’s remains were disinterred from the jail in December 1945 and reburied in Singapore on 13 January 1946, on a hill overlooking MacRitchie Reservoir. In February 1946, the Chinese Nationalist government posthumously awarded him the rank of major-general.",5,65,6
308,"As part of the WWII monument walk, this one certainly is a pretty stop. The structure itself is beautiful and in a scenic location.",4,65,1
309,"A nice place for picnic and chill in the middle of the city, but many people smoke in the park and leave leftovers on the floor. That annoy me.",3,65,2
310,"Cool to read and learn about Singapore history. Especially, this general from World War II.",5,65,3
311,"Dreamy location if you are in Singapore, a must-visit place. A fun, enjoyable, and exciting day you are going to experience here if you are visiting. One full day is required here.  You have to buy passes in advance. Also, if you can install their application and check the wait time for each activity. For kids, adults, they have a Range of activities. They have introduced Minion Land and kids just love this.  The best ride is Transformers and The Mummy. They also have food stalls available. The Jurassic Park ride is just awesome. Pls bring a raincoat if you are planning for the Jurassic Park ride. Express pass is not required if you are visiting jn off off-season. On Sunday, they have parade.",5,66,2
312,Nice experience with family. Needs a full day to explore the park. Be prepared for long waiting times sometimes up to 2 hours for a single ride. Buy the express pass if you can afford it. Food is good and reasonably priced compared to other such theme parks. We liked the one in Oasis cafe in the Egyptian section.,5,66,3
313,"What an amazing theme park. Universal Singapore may be small, but it has so much packed within it. You could easily spend the whole day here and still not manage to do and see it all. This place is fun for the whole family. There are roller coasters, thrill rides, and shows that make the whole experience worthwhile.",5,66,4
314,A very good Theme Park to bring your kids. However authority should take necessary measures to limit the number of guests inside the Studio as currently you have to wait 45-120 minutes just for a 2/3 minutes ride. As a result people can not enjoy all the ride and can not roam around the park freely.,2,66,5
315,"I had more fun than expected however we paid over AUD 1000 for three kids limited express tickets and two adult entry passes and there were a number of rides closed for maintenance, particularly the Lost World ride which was the only one I was interested in. This should have been advised in advance or the FULL price should not have been charged by the park. Lunch was also difficult to find seating. Overall though the staff were friendly and welcoming and the family had a good time.",3,66,6
316,"This is a very good place to take the kids and keep them busy throughout the day. There are a variety of things to do. Lots of activities to keep them interested. They can choose what they like and spend time there.  My kids didn't want to leave. Very well maintained.  Only we wasted time with the book with questions and answers as the answers were in a corridor and not finding answers through practicals (which we assumed it would be).  Nevertheless, the kids had a ball and definitely wanted to go there again.",5,67,3
317,"We had fun here. We came slightly after 10am, bought ticket onsite via website. $6 per adult and $4 per child. Scan in the QR ticket and enter through gate.  Walked around 1 hr plus and reached lightning show at 12pm. It was electrifying show. Went for lunch at coffee hive (the only restaurant inside), there is one outside as well with long queue. Walked another 1 hr plus and watched the show at 2:30pm for fire tornado. It was hot standing in the front.  Wasn't planned to spend the whole day here but ended up till 4pm.  It was a lot of good information learned from this place.",5,67,4
318,All the concepts in science especially physics is explained very well with lot of practical examples and exhibition of items to explain the same in a simple way. Must visit place at Singapore for kids and adults to understand physics well. Tickets are sold only in online and hence booking the time slot before you arrive here is advisable. One day may not be fully enough to visit all areas. 12 PM and 2.30 PM show on lightening and fire tornado are not be missed.  Coffee shop with noodles and an Indian restaurant are available inside.,5,67,5
319,"Absolutely loved it. So many things to see, you'll need hours here to see it all. You can grab a bite to eat with kaya toast or fries in the middle at the Coffee Bee, or something more substantial. They have water, coffee or soft drinks as well.  The fire tornado at 2:30pm is fantastic to see, kids loved it. So many amazing exhibits, adults and kids alike had a wonderful time.",5,67,6
320,"Science is great! It’s free for Permanent Residents of Singapore but foreign people must pay. There is an escape room game. It is a bit dim there. Colorful lights sparkle in the dark. Outside at the entrance, there is a waterpark. Also there is a gift shop inside. The museum’s collection includes dinosaur bones, solar system, our mind, angles, light and shadow and odd vision. Laser maze is like an adventure through a phantom city! There are some hands-on activities. You should come here to learn!",5,67,1
321,"We were in the Telok Ayer area running a quick errand when the charming entrance of Fuk Tak Chi Museum caught our attention. It looked so distinctive and inviting that we couldn’t resist taking a closer look.  The space radiated a timeless charm. With its traditional layout and vintage-inspired furnishings, it felt warm, welcoming, and full of character. Stepping inside was like taking a brief journey into the past—we found ourselves lingering, soaking in the atmosphere and snapping a few photos along the way.  To our surprise, we soon realized we had wandered into Amoy Hotel. That’s when we spotted its slogan: “Every journey is an experience.” It couldn’t have been more fitting. What started as a simple errand turned into a delightful and unexpected discovery—one of those spontaneous moments that leaves a lasting impression.",5,68,4
322,"Tucked away on Telok Ayer Street, the Fuk Tak Chi Museum is a hidden gem that seamlessly blends Singapore’s rich cultural tapestry with modern-day charm. Originally established between 1820 and 1824 by Cantonese and Hakka immigrants, this site began as a temple dedicated to Tua Pek Kong, serving both religious and communal functions for early Chinese settlers . ￼ ￼  In 1998, the temple was thoughtfully restored and transformed into Singapore’s first street museum, preserving over 200 artifacts that narrate the lives and traditions of early Chinese migrants . Visitors can explore life-sized dioramas, historical photographs, and ceremonial objects that vividly depict the immigrant experience . ￼  Adding a unique twist, the museum now serves as the entrance to the boutique Amoy Hotel, creating a harmonious blend of heritage and hospitality . This integration offers guests and visitors alike an immersive journey through Singapore’s past right from the doorstep. ￼",5,68,5
323,"This is a small museum in the Telok Ayer street district very close to the Central Business District.  It’s been lovingly restored from its past as a Chinese temple and is a quiet oasis in the midst of modern Singapore to remember the beginnings of the Cantonese and Hakka communities in Singapore in Telok Ayer which housed the first settlers.  The museum is small but is in the style of old Chinese houses / temples, with a central courtyard and open “skylight”.  There is a wonderful miniature model of what the first settlements would have looked like, a bronze statue of a peddler and a replica of the old “junk” boats (which were really called “junks”)that settlers would have lived on for the two week or so journey from Southern China to Singapore.  In addition, there are some old daily artifacts like sewing machines, and old immigration papers. The rest of the space houses a boutique hotel the Amoy.  As someone whose grandfather was one of those settlers so long ago, the museum and its exhibits allowed me to picture what life might have been like for him, even though I never met him.  I found the museum very moving, almost a spiritual experience and I will be back each time I come to Singapore.  So grateful for those who have set up the museum and maintain it today.  Admission is free.",5,68,6
324,"Free admission. Fuk Tak Chi 福德祠 was a Chinese temple previously for ""Fu De Zheng Shen 福德正神"" ～ Taoist god of Wealth and Merit. It’s now a tiny little museum with exhibits on Chinese immigrants around this area in the 1800s;  do come and check it out if you’re within the area.",3,68,1
325,Well preserved little slice of what remained of Singapore history. Definitely worth spending 10 minutes just looking around and soak it in. The replica of the old street is where you can find exactly where you are in history.,5,68,2
326,"I had an incredible experience with Angeline as our guide for the Peranakan culture tour, by appointment only through Pelago. She was truly fantastic—knowledgeable, approachable, and always eager to share her expertise. Throughout the tour, she provided fascinating insights into Peranakan heritage and culture, making the history come alive in a way that was both engaging and informative.  The Katong Antique House has many interesting artefacts on display. Each item told a unique story, and Angeline did an excellent job of explaining their significance.  Highly recommend this experience for anyone interested in Peranakan culture. It's a great opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of this rich and vibrant heritage!",5,69,4
327,"We had an incredible experience with Angeline, who herself belong to Peranakans. We felt she is not only knowedable about the heritage and culture but she is passionate about it She was so patient , shared a lot of unique stories and clarified some misinformation we have related to Peranakan culture. She explained each nook and corners, artifacts, culture with so much ease and happiness. I really like the way she is preserving such a rich culture and sharing the untold and unknown first hand informations",5,69,5
328,"An amazing peek into a colourful and rich culture born when the Chinese came down to Malacca, Penang and married the locals thus the first Peranakans or straits born Chinese. The narrative was detailed and full of little anecdotes of those times. Thank you. It was enjoyable",5,69,6
329,"Great place to learn about Peranakan culture and history. The place is only open upon appointment if I'm not wrong. Went there recently to learn beading.

331,"Wow, where do I start? When you walk into the park it’s kinda meh experience. Sure, the bridge is nice and there is good few nice trees and such, that huge pagoda in the background looks promising, but it’s kinda empty. Not like the Sydney one, jam packed with things. But then you start walking around and you see the genius of it. It’s not all squeezed in into one tiny space. Oh no! It’s perfectly designed to keep you excited all the time. And the beauty of this place! Not only that, this place is a literal sanctuary for so many animals, right in the middle of busy (and you need to go to Singapore or Hong Kong to understand what busy means) housing area. Without any effort whatsoever I’ve seen two huge monitors, 2-3 lizards, super friendly squirrels and tons of birds. Just like that. Loved the tiny pagodas, loved the zodiac, the maps are of great help. Spent there over two and a half hours and only left to see the second one. The Japanese garden.",5,70,4
332,Free admission. A nice Traditional Chinese Garden with some modern elements. Worth a visit when you’re around western Singapore.  The Japanese Garden is nearby and with free admission too. It’s less traditional with lots of modern elements though.,4,70,5
333,"There is ongoing construction work near Chinese Garden MRT station but there is prospect to be a good attraction for tourists. Currently, it's still good if only for jogging places. There's enough toilets, free drinking water refills and everyone can enter without any admission.",4,70,6
334,"Visited this park again after 8–9 years, and I’m glad to see how much it has changed! They’ve revamped quite a bit, added more eateries, and maintained it really well. Still as pretty as ever—love how they’ve kept the charm while improving the space!",5,70,1
335,"A very beautiful park with both Chinese and Japanese gardens, and more. You can take a walk, cycle, or run while enjoying the scenic views, or simply relax and have a picnic. There are plenty of rest areas, restrooms, and restaurants available. Unfortunately, the lake water was dirty when I visited, but the overall atmosphere is still peaceful and enjoyable.",5,70,2
336,"The beach park itself was beautiful. But what I loved even more was riding a bike along the wide, well-maintained paths. It felt calm and free.  Singapore is such a bike-friendly city. Bike lanes are clearly marked, traffic is light, and drivers are incredibly respectful. You really feel safe on the road, which makes the whole experience even more enjoyable.  The sunlight, the shadows, and the green from the trees blended together so perfectly. fresh, peaceful, and just quietly beautiful.",5,71,1
337,"Nice serene place for a Good walk during weekend. This beach offers Lots of human activities engagement which includes: Swimming, BBQ, Gathering of families and friends for a simple picnic as well as couples wishing to spend some time winding down.

Just be mindful that some car parks are chargeable while some are free parking. Lots of varieties of food to choose at East Coast lagoon food centre as well. Other options includes fast food like McDonald",5,71,2
338,"Best beach you can find in Singapore, plenty of parking lots, restaurant and cafe, pet friendly too. The park was beautiful and there were many tables and bench for resting. You can rent bicycles here to cycle along the coaster. The road was built wide enough for an enjoyable ride, you will feel safe as they are separated from the walking pavement. Along the way you can find restaurant,  cafe, children playground and toilets for your needs. There are areas for camping and bbq, and it is definitely a good place for family gatherings.",5,71,3
339,"Very laid back vibes. Just sit, relax and enjoy the time. You can also rent cycles and take a ride across the long stretch. Swimming is not recommended as the water may not be ideal and sometimes a bit murky because of the busy global ship route in the Singaporean strait connecting the Indian Ocean with the South China sea.",5,71,4
340,"I frequently visit East Coast park as it is on one of my exercise walking routes. The hawker center has something for every taste, the walk paths and surrounding areas are well maintained and groomed.

344,"The last time I came here was seven or eight years ago. Back then, there weren't so many people taking photos here. But today, when I came again, there were a huge crowd. It's because this place has become extremely popular online recently and turned into a viral check-in spot. I even waited in line for two hours just to take a photo here.",5,72,6
345,"Fort Canning Park was one of the photo locations I really wanted to visit during my trip to Singapore and it did not disappoint! The spot is famous for its iconic spiral staircase, and it’s absolutely worth the visit if you're into photography or simply want a unique picture memory.  For solo travelers, You can easily set up your tripod without any issues. I also happened to meet a friendly part-time photographer inside the park who offered to take my photos. He charged just $5 for 15  pictures, and honestly, it was totally worth it.  A tip: go early in the morning to avoid the long queue that forms near the popular staircase. Entrance to the park is free, which makes the experience even better. Beautiful, peaceful, and photo perfect highly recommended for solo and group travelers alike!",5,72,1
346,"Lovely location to relax, enjoy the beaches (including Lazarus Island) and look at the Chinese Temple and tortoise sanctuary. Would have been good to have had a sign with information about the sanctuary, e.g. were these rescued tortoises? Great service from Island Cruise Ferries.",4,73,4
347,"A peaceful getaway from the mainland starting with a comfortable ride in air-conditioned ferry on a guided community tour. The island was serene, charming and quiet. Met the caretaker of the island who explained the history, and challenges of maintaining the island. Enjoyable experience, and worth coming here",5,73,5
348,"A welcome dose of peace and quiet, Away from the city grind, a chance to hear my own thoughts again in kusu. The 152 steps climb wasn’t easy, but the view was a good payoff. Kusu is A chance to reflect without pressure and The temple, the shrines, the turtles offer a life stripped back to essentials.",5,73,6
349,"This is a nice little island to visit for picnic, swimming and snorkeling (other than just visiting the temple) There are two lagoons and one of them offers clear view of marina bay. Many pavilions with picnic tables next to the beach. There’s also a functional toilet and outdoor shower for swimmers :) (though a bit rundown and unpleasant due to old age) To our surprise, we also found the beach with thriving with lots of lives. At about 4pm, the tide is low enough and you can just walk in the lagoon. This is when we found a lot of hermit crabs, crabs, fish and even some corals :))) Very fun visit in short. I’ll definitely return for another picnic or swimming",5,73,1
350,"Packed with foreigners during PH which ruined the nice vibes of the island. Otherwise, it’s pretty overrated in my opinion as the place is like an offshore East Coast Park. The turtle pond looks sad and not well maintained. Nothing much to do here. Save the day by going to other islands instead.",3,73,2
351,"Bird Paradise was excellent.  Birds are out even in the heat of the day.  The park was planned with air-conditioned areas to give you a break from the heat just when you are starting to get really hot.  I especially recommend the Backstage Pass Penguin Encounter. The price may seem high, but it is definitely worth it.  We had at least 10 penguins frolicking around us. It was definitely something I'll never forget.  Just beware of the Penguin poop.",5,74,6
352,"Well designed birds park that is rightly named as a Paradise for birds. It was an innovative design where the birds were set free inside a huge controlled environment. Each segment had like birds together so they will not be disturbed. It’s nice to see birds flying around and sitting on one’s head or shoulders. The segments are connected by AV based information rooms, which are air conditioned and had resting set up. The flamingo land with the waterfall was very astonishing. Don’t miss on the shows where the birds can be seen performing. Strollers are available for rent for the infants. Mother feeding rooms and baby care rooms were very neatly maintained.",5,74,1
353,"Bird Paradise Singapore was such a lovely experience – truly one of the highlights of our trip. The park is beautifully done, full of lush greenery and open spaces, and you’re surrounded by birds from all over the world. It felt peaceful, fun, and really refreshing to spend a day here.  The penguins were an absolute delight! Watching them swim around and play was just too cute – we could’ve stood there for hours. And don’t miss the “Wings of the World” show – it was honestly impressive. The birds flew right above us and the trainers did a great job explaining each one. It was exciting, fun, and informative all at once.  The park layout is easy to follow, and there are lots of shaded areas to take a break. There are also water refill stations throughout, which is great if you’re carrying your own bottles.  That said, the weather was super humid during our visit. We were sweating quite a bit, so I’d definitely suggest bringing a small portable fan and wearing breathable clothes. Also, while the refill stations were handy, the water wasn’t chilled – and trust me, on a hot day, you’ll wish it was!  Still, those are minor things. The overall experience was just beautiful. The birds are well taken care of, the staff was helpful and friendly, and you can tell a lot of love and thought went into creating this place. If you’re visiting Singapore, Bird Paradise should definitely be on your list.",4,74,2
354,"I’ve been to Bird Paradise twice, and the penguin exhibit remains my favourite. It’s such a joy to watch them up close in a cool, comfortable setting. While most of the park is outdoors, it’s great that each zone includes an air-conditioned indoor section for a break from the heat. I watched both shows and personally enjoyed Wings of Asia more. The performances were impressive and well-paced. Overall, a fun and well-thought-out experience for all ages.",5,74,3
355,"Excellent presentation at Predators on Wings show. The hosts and the thought behind the program was so good and impressive. It’s always such a privilege to be up close to these creatures.  Bird Paradise is amazing in itself, walking through enclosures up close to the animals. There is nothing better and gots of rest space in between with AC.",5,74,4

361,"I think this is a great water park, their rides, enough lifeguards and  especially their reef swim experience. But their snorkeling equipment is really not kept up to maintenance, snorkeling mask leaked, snorkeling tube isn't the right mouth guard size.. meant more for kids.  Otherwise, it would be a great experience.  The way they handle end of day park closure would need further improvements, there isnt enough shower facilities and yet the closed the shower facilities that was near the reef swim area, forcing everyone to only use the shower facilities by the park entrance! The queue was for another hour at least, I left without showering, just chsnged to dry clothes and left. they can improve on the way they end the day's operation would be better.",3,76,5

Some rides do have a height and weight restriction. There are lockers where you can put your items away and they have different sizing options. The popular rides are the different slides, wave pool, river ride (where you’ll experience random waves, splashes and underwater tanks) and snorkelling. There is a place for a feed when you’re famished and they do great satay which are cooked as you order. Lots of photo opportunities and you get to buy them on your way out.

365,"Adventure Cove Waterpark is a less than 10 minute walk from the Resorts World Sentosa monorail station (one stop from the Harbourfront MRT station at the top of VivoCity. It is a great way to cool off with splash zones, rides, snorkelling, and of course, the lazy river circling the entire area. Bring your own beach towel unless you want to pay $30 at the shop. There are lockers at the front by the change room as well as another set of lockers by the wave pool and restaurant. Lines for the rides get longer by 11 so coming earlier is better. There is also a ray feeding opportunity which is short but fun.",5,76,3
366,"One of the most relaxing areas you can visit while in Singapore in the evening, have a drink at one of  the many bars on the waterfront.  When all of the skyline is lit up at night, it's magical with the reflections on the water...definitely a place to be on the Promenade.",5,77,4

The vibrant heritage architecture is perfect for anyone who appreciates history, design, or just a good photo opportunity.  After taking some photos, you can enjoy a coffee at one of the nearby local cafés. The walk to the nearest MRT is pleasant, with lots of interesting local shops, a boxing gym, and even a vinyl record store along the way.",4,78,2
372,"Every corner tells a story. Walking through the space felt like stepping into a different era. A must-visit for anyone who appreciates history, architecture, or just want a meaningful escape in the city.",5,78,3
373,"There're several colorful houses in a row. It was a pretty cute view. It takes about 10 minutes from Marine Parade station on foot. There are a variety of shops like cafes on the way. So, you won't feel so far away from the station.",4,78,4
374,Beautiful and colorful Paranakan Houses. It can get pretty crowded with lots of tourist trying take photos of these rows of beautiful houses. So come early,5,78,5
375,"Pretty houses. Nothing to visit, just a view from the street. There are alternatives near Orchard Road that may be more convenient.",4,78,6
376,"Love sentosa Already spent few full days at the place, but I feel like there are still a lots to discover  This place, you can bring anyone and still can find some activities to enjoy with.  I already spent time at Universal (1d), Water Cove Park, Aquarium, HarryPotter museum All are worth it, but what I hate is I have to queue a lots",5,79,6
377,A nice and quiet beach day for me.  Come here on a weekday sun and beach time.  Very relaxing.  The water was warm and cooling at the same time on a sunny hot humid day.  A very nice walk along the beach.,5,79,1
378,"It’s a beautiful island. There’s a monorail that connects different stations. Universal Studios, Sea aquarium, Madame Tussauds museum are in this island. The sea looks beautiful, you can take a cable car ride and view the entire island. There’s a show called “Wings of time”, it’s a lifetime experience !",5,79,2
379,"Sentosa Island is a vibrant and action-packed destination with something for everyone. From thrilling attractions like Universal Studios Singapore, Skyline Luge, and the new LEGO World and Harry Potter: Visions of Magic to relaxing beaches and scenic walking trails, it’s truly a must-visit. The best way to reach Sentosa is by the cable car from Mount Faber, which offers beautiful views and comes in different fun themes. There’s also a bridge connecting the mainland, but the cable car adds an extra bit of charm to the experience. The island is quite large, and trying to cover all the attractions in one day isn’t really practical—Universal Studios alone takes an entire day to fully enjoy. For beach lovers and foodies, there are plenty of beaches and restaurants offering a wide range of cuisines, making it a great spot for a gastronomic adventure. We tried the Skyline Luge, which was exciting and a little thrilling, though we had to wait quite a while as it was a weekend and the place was crowded. I recommend arriving early and using the tram service to get around the island easily. All in all, Sentosa is a perfect blend of fun, nature, and leisure.",5,79,3
380,"Was a magical place. Great for kids and adults.  Lots to do here for everyone.  Cable car ride is brilliant and great value for money to see the island from above.  Beaches, theme parks, shops, cafes, ice-cream, and a whole lot more.  Very easy to navigate around.  The luge, here is so much fun and didn't have long wait queues.  Safety briefings are given to everyone and also safety equipment is provided.  Choose how many rides you want with four rides for $36, making this attraction great value for everyone.  Also you can pay extra for footage of you on the luge but scanning your helmet.  Four rides including the ski lift to do it all again will take you approximately 30 mins if there is a small queue.  So this activity here I can take a while, filling your day well.  Madam Tussauds is great as well.  This is located near the luge and is a great attraction as well.  Universal Studios here as well if you are looking for a fabulous day out.  Lots to do here and feels like the ones in Florida but just a bit smaller.  Get yourself over to Sentosa for a great family day out. This is equally suitable for couples or if you are travelling alone.  Well branded eateries over there as well.",5,79,4
381,"This temple is absolutely stunning. From the detailed architecture on the outside to the rich golden interior, it is filled with peaceful energy. Every floor is worth exploring, especially the main hall, which leaves a strong impression.  There was no wait to enter, and the entire experience felt calm and respectful. The atmosphere is perfect for reflection and quiet appreciation.  I highly recommend visiting this temple when in Singapore. Even if you’re not Buddhist, the beauty and serenity of this place are truly remarkable.",5,81,4
382,"​I had a truly unforgettable experience visiting the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple. It's a stunning and beautiful temple, and I feel so grateful to have had the opportunity to be there. I was particularly impressed by the incredible collection of ancient Buddha statues, Chinese angels, and other historical artifacts. There is so much to see and explore, and every corner tells a story. It was a very memorable and moving visit.",5,81,5
383,"The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is truly a spiritual and architectural gem in the heart of Chinatown, Singapore. The intricate Tang-style architecture, stunning golden interiors, and sacred relics create a deeply reverent atmosphere. The main prayer hall is breathtaking, and the upper floors—especially the museum and rooftop garden with the giant prayer wheel—are worth exploring. The temple is both a place of worship and a cultural hub, offering insight into Buddhist traditions and art.",4,81,6
384,"This was a very cool temple to see during the day and night. If you visit during the day, admission is free and it’s open from 7 am to 5 pm Monday to Sunday. The main room has Buddhists saying their prayers but there are other gods that can be worshipped. Important things to note: no barebacks, off shoulders, shorts, or mini skirts. No non vegetarian food or pets inside the temple. It’s located in Chinatown and by the Maxwell food center.",5,81,1
385,"The Buddha Tooth Relic Temple is a must-see when visiting Chinatown. Unlike many temples, it’s fully air-conditioned and not smoky, making for a comfortable experience. The temple itself is beautifully designed, with museum-like relics displayed on the upper floors and a serene roof garden that adds to the peaceful atmosphere.  I felt a deep sense of calm while exploring the temple. The facilities are excellent, with very clean toilets available, and there's even a basement cafeteria for a quick bite or drink.  Highly recommended for anyone looking to appreciate culture, history, and a moment of peace in the heart of the city.",5,81,2
386,"Went for a walk on Sunday evening and it turned out to be such a peaceful and relaxing time. The park was quiet, which made it even nicer. Caught the sunset while strolling and it was absolutely beautiful. The breeze, the calm vibes, and the golden light made the whole experience feel like a perfect little break from the city rush. Would definitely come back again for another slow evening walk.",5,82,4
387,"My wife and I went for a jog from our place all the way to the beautiful Labrador Nature Reserve, and it was an incredible experience. The moment we arrived, we were surrounded by lush greenery on one side and the calming sea on the other truly a breathtaking contrast that made the jog even more rewarding.  What makes this spot even more special is the view of the Singapore Cable Car gliding smoothly across the sky in the distance, adding a touch of charm to the already stunning scenery. Whether you’re looking for a peaceful walk, a scenic jog, or just a relaxing time with nature, Labrador Nature Reserve is definitely worth the visit.",5,82,5
388,"Very peaceful, clean and well maintained. I enjoyed the scenery and the fair amount of shades and resting points. There were beautiful wildlife to explore and observe on the way. There were clean toilets too! Great short walk for a 1-2 hour walk!",5,82,6
389,"A lovely place for a run or a walk or just to soak in a nice coastal vista. There is a lot to see, so to speak, with nice walkways, bridges, jetties, a marina and architecturally beautiful buildings. And there is a nice sea breeze as you do all these things.",5,82,1
390,"Definitely one of the better areas to walk around here. We got to experience lots of wildlife and got some great pictures. It’s gets very windy when you are close to the coast but overall, definitely worth a visit.",5,82,2
391,"Easy to get to. Easy to rent a bike. Definitely would make sure not to miss the pick low tide on the tidal bit next time in order to observe the marine wildlife trapped in pools. Lots of little shrines and temples, bring your binoculars for the birds watch definitely worth it. I struggled with the heat in the afternoon so be mindful of that. Bring cash.",4,83,2
392,"It was a company event, with local guides and vans to fetch us to the wetlands.  If you're walking or cycling, please be cautious of vehicles.  It's interesting to learn about the habitats and experience the living organisms and plants.  Please wear insect repellent before entering the protected wetlands to protect yourself from the mosquitoes.",4,83,3
393,Such a beautiful and varied landscape with lots of animals! Both the mangrove tour and the walk on the coast were lovely and not too long. I recommend coming here by bike. Watch out for the monkeys! Don’t leave your bag or other belongings unattended.,5,83,4
394,"A good nature walk for the family. Quite a treat when it’s during low tide where you can see fish, fiddler crabs and other marine life eg mud crabs, swimming or roaming in their habitats. Monkeys are a constant. Be careful of your belongings and be mindful not to bring any plastic bags or open tote bags as these fellas will not be afraid to pull them off you and rummage through. If that happens, do not resist or pull the bags but just  wait for them to stop and collect the items back. You wouldn’t want to be attacked or worse still create a commotion where the monkey calls in the calvary… you can take a pretty long walk from the jetty to reach here, cycle or get the “taxi vans” on the island to bring you there. A round trip costs SGD6 per pax.",5,83,5
395,"What a Lovely place it is, away from the city. Was a bit worried visiting here, as thought this place is too wild, but the road is paved, and has parking area for bicycles, good enough to go around for a day trip. Thanks to enormous trees, the hot weather was mild than I worried about.",5,83,6
396,"Singapore's iconic spot. Very busy during the day. The views presented are stunning and even though it is busy you still get a beautiful view, just to sit quietly and enjoy the atmosphere. Walking Walking across the river and bridge looking from a distance is very beautiful.",5,84,5
397,"Average tourist attraction for pictures, nothing special but you can make nice perspective photos. Make sure there's no ceremony going on (e.g. national day parade) as they might close the area around the statue. Very crowded most of the time.",3,84,6
398,Had 8 hours transit in Singapore and decided to go here. Always an iconic landmark of Singapore so no regrets! Easy to reach by public transport and good spot for taking iconic photos with the Merlion. P.S: beware of the sun!,5,84,1
399,"What a beautiful place, especially in the night. They lit it so beautifully and you want to keep looking at the amazing sight. Is better to go there is evenings, as it’s less hot n humid. Also the Singapore skyline is very nicely lit up as well. There is no ticket to come to this place and it’s open 24x7, which makes it even awesome. If you are in Singapore, a visit to this place is a must and your Singapore trip would be incomplete, if you miss this sight ?",5,84,2
400,"Most picturesque place of Singapore. Evening are best time to visit, variety of restaurants and full of locals and tourists. A great evening.",5,84,3
401,"Absolutely breathtaking! The SkyPark Observation Deck offers one of the most spectacular panoramic views in all of Singapore. From the top, you get an unbeatable look at the city skyline, Gardens by the Bay, and the sparkling Marina Bay — it truly feels like you’re floating above the city.  As a guest at the Marina Bay Sands hotel, I was able to enjoy this incredible experience without having to pay for admission, which made it even better! It’s definitely a perk worth taking advantage of if you're staying at the hotel.  Whether you're visiting during the day or catching the sunset over the skyline, it’s an unforgettable sight. Highly recommend making time for it — camera essential!",5,85,3
402,"Great views over the city and its surrounds they change as the sun sets. We used it to see the spectacular light show in Gardens in the Bay and the laser light show nearby and I would advise against this. These were both disappointing as they lacked the atmosphere of the shows at ground level. You could not hear the music which enhances the shows and some of the effects in the laser light show were difficult to see. Viewing positions are also at a premium so you need to decide which light show you want to see most to get a decent view. If you want great views of the city then worth the money if you want to see the light shows then watch them at ground level and for free, for a better experience.",3,85,4
403,"Wow, what an experience ? I was having thoughts about visiting or not. But visiting the deck was an excellent choice. Breathtaking view of the Singapore skyline. It was worth the hype. You could also see the super tree grove from the top. This place is such a vibe ❤️?",5,85,5
404,"This point is very popular so you need to book the visit in advance, especially when you want to catch sunset. Also, for the restaurant you need reservations otherwise you won’t catch a sit (as we didn’t know and missed it). The view towards the gardens is spectacular, and the sunset above the tall buildings is great too. Entrance pretty expensive, 39$.",5,85,6
405,Please buy tickets in advance. The tickets will get sold out. The observation deck offers a stunning panoramic view of the Singapore skyline. The lucky few might get to observe the sunset. The deck gets closed upon rain. You will be allowed to visit again. The snacks and drinks are not that overpriced here.,4,85,1
406,"We got to explore Resorts World Sentosa before heading into Universal Studios—and it was already such a fun start! Took the train in with my husband and two boys, wandered around, ate way too much, and of course, took a photo outside the Harry Potter store (next time we’re going in ?). Loved the lively vibe, cool shops, and little surprises everywhere. Perfect way to warm up for a theme park day!",5,86,5
407,"Overall a great place to stay for comfort, service and location  Nice size room. We had our 15 year old granddaughter with us and the room was not cluttered. It actually had a double and two singles. The TV wasn't great but we hardly watched. The location is close to a free bus stop and over the road from Universal but you need to get the bus to get to the entrance which is just a short drive. The hotel also has a shuttle to the large mall. We added breakfasts for a low price and they were excellent, a full buffet of choice. We had dinner twice and the food was nice although maybe a bit pricey compared to some options and portions. There's a nice pool on the roof with a view although it was closed for maintenence without warning the night we wanted to watch the light show and there's lovely big pools a short walk (dream pool) for laps and relaxing. Room service was great and they also arranged taxis and shuttles on request and stored our bags for the day on check out so we could still explore. Overall very satisfied for price and location. Front desk very polite and efficient.",5,86,6
408,I visit this place with my cousin for Harry Potter vision of magic. It was great that we got great mini bar and the walking distance to all connected place feel amazing. They got great choice of food that we can purchased from in hotel lobby even for after hours. Great gym as well,5,86,1
409,"Visited Resorts World Sentosa – July 2025  Dropped by Resorts World Sentosa in mid-July 2025. Noticed quite a lot of upgrading and renovation works in progress. Even the walkway from VivoCity to Sentosa is partially detoured due to enhancement works.  Despite the construction, the area still draws plenty of tourists, especially over the weekends.  Once all the upgrades are complete, I believe the resort will become even more premium and enjoyable—definitely something to look forward to in the next couple of years.",4,86,2
410,"My visit to Sentosa Island was absolutely fantastic and a highlight of my time in Singapore. There's such a diverse range of activities, from the thrilling Universal Studios to the relaxing beaches, ensuring there's something for everyone. I particularly enjoyed the beautiful scenery and the vibrant atmosphere throughout the island. The ease of getting around, whether by monorail or cable car, made the experience even more enjoyable. It's truly a perfect escape from the city hustle and bustle!",5,86,3
411,"The Singapore Botanic Gardens is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and it's easy to see why. You can enjoy a wide variety of beautiful plants and freely explore the well-maintained lawns. Scattered throughout the gardens are scenic lakes, waterfalls, and ponds that enhance the peaceful atmosphere. It’s a popular destination for both tourists and locals, offering a perfect blend of nature, relaxation, and photo opportunities. Highly recommended for a refreshing day out.",4,87,4
412,"On our final day in Singapore, we decided to take a relaxing walk through the beautifully landscaped Singapore Botanic Gardens. It truly exceeded expectations and is one of the most impressive gardens I’ve visited across my travels. There are countless zones to explore, from lakes and waterfalls to dense forest boardwalks and palm tree-lined lawns.  You’d never think you were in the middle of a major city. Once inside, it feels like a natural retreat, with open grassy spaces, peaceful shaded paths, and birds bathing in the water features. We followed the signs at various junctions which made it really easy to navigate the gardens and choose our route.  The walk is easygoing with smooth, wide paths, and plenty of benches and rest stops along the way. One of the highlights was discovering a tucked-away waterfall and just pausing to take it all in. There's also a scenic lake surrounded by lush greenery that gave us some great photo moments.  It's free to enter and an absolute gem for anyone wanting a calm break from the city. A perfect way to unwind and breathe in some nature before heading back to the buzz of Singapore. Would absolutely recommend setting aside a few hours to enjoy it properly.",5,87,5
413,"Singapore Botanic Garden is absolutely magnificent! Most areas are free to explore, and the National Orchid Garden (which has an entry fee) is stunning and showcases orchids I had never seen before. It’s also a perfect spot for a picnic and a peaceful escape from the city. I highly recommend visiting while in Singapore as part of the gardens is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site",5,87,6
414,Very beautiful and relaxing. We visited on a weekday and it was large enough that it did not feel very crowded. The orchid garden is worth the money to go into. The gift shop is also cute!,5,87,1
415,"Fabulous place for picnic, spend time to wind down, listen to music symphony, or simply a stroll or run. For us, we were there for a musical concert with family and extended family. Plenty of places to place your mat and enjoy music, wine, champagne and catching up with loved ones while watching sunset. Other than car park fees, it is free. Except for Orchid Garden that requires a fee. Symphony Lake is accessible from downtown line - botanic gardens or from TEL - Napier main gate and walk towards Orchid Gardens.",5,87,2
416,"Nice to walk through and amazingly less mosquitoes. A lot of wildlife and even witnessed a fight between smooth coated otters and a eustraine crocodile. Many friendly bird watchers and biologists. And also just to inform, there is a Chinese softshell turtle basking on the rock everyday at 10am, it's near the visitor center and fun to watch, look up at the roof, there is a colony of lesser short nosed fruit bats chilling there. Wonderful place I guarantee",5,88,6
417,"Free entry and you can walk on your own.  Go during good weather days. Good to walk but there are some grounds which will be muddy if it rains the day before.  Kids can walk too. Not rough roads. Good exercise for everyone. Nice view and fresh air.  You may be lucky enough to see monitor lizards, spiders, crocodile, birds... open your eyes and enjoy the nature!",4,88,1
418,"It’s an amazing place with greenery ???all around. Went on a Sat in May , not much crowded.  The trail can be easily done my young ( teens) and old… ???‍??‍?  Kudos to the ground team ? for keeping the place very well maintained and all care is taken to ensure a smooth experience throughout.. with ample washrooms and resting (shed) places and a food court ( just has vending machines ?)  You are welcomed by friendly Komodo’s ? in the park ??",5,88,2
419,"My favorite “park”. A great getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city. A huge plus is that there are no macaques here. Good diversity of migratory birds and other wildlife. Try to go during low tide to spot the crocodiles. Hard to get public transport/taxi/grab, will need to drive in",5,88,3
420,"Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve is a hidden gem in Singapore for nature lovers and wildlife enthusiasts. It’s a peaceful escape from the city, with well-maintained trails and plenty of opportunities to spot native flora and fauna.  Highly recommend for a peaceful walk surrounded by nature — it’s one of the best spots in Singapore to connect with the wild side of the island.",5,88,4
421,"I was truly amazed by the transformation of the Singapore Oceanarium, especially the mesmerizing jellyfish exhibits with their graceful, glowing movements. ???? The deep-sea exploration zones, like the life-sized whale skeleton structure, made me feel like I was diving into the ocean’s mysterious depths! The experience was not just entertaining but also a powerful reminder of conservation and protecting marine life. ?? Seeing Singapore’s local coastal species reminded me how connected we are to the ocean. ?? After the trip, I left with a deeper appreciation for the sea and a commitment to be more mindful of our planet’s fragile ecosystems.????",5,89,3
422,"The S.E.A. Aquarium in Singapore is an underwater wonderland that makes you feel like you’re walking through the ocean itself. With over 100,000 marine animals from more than 1,000 species, it’s one of the largest and most impressive aquariums in the world.  My favorite part was the massive Open Ocean Habitat, where giant manta rays, groupers, and even sharks glide right past you. It’s peaceful, fascinating, and honestly a little magical. The tunnel walk-through also gives you that awesome “under-the-sea” vibe.  Everything is clean, well-organized, and educational. There are tons of signs and digital displays explaining the ecosystems, which makes it great for learning too.",4,89,4
423,"I first visited this aquarium when I was younger, and the massive tank left a lasting impression in my core memory, sparking my love for marine life and aquariums. It’s absolutely mesmerizing—a stunning place to explore. The ticket prices are reasonable, and the exhibits are beautifully designed. I also appreciate their strong focus on conservation and education, which is something I deeply value. Spend a few hours here—you won’t regret it! I was super fulfilled after getting here.  The only thing I’d change is the souvenir shop’s location and size. It’s too small and not placed at the end of the aquarium. I assumed there would be a bigger shop at the exit, so I skipped the one in the middle of the route. Unfortunately, by the time we were leaving, it was too crowded to go back, and we missed the chance to buy anything. Please consider adding a larger souvenir shop at the end—I’d love to buy plenty!",5,89,5
424,"The aquarium is truly world-class; however, the creatures are so vibrant that when we passed by the large fish tank, we couldn’t help but exclaim “wow,” feeling as if we were deep under the blue ocean. If you bring a child along, they’ll learn many valuable lessons about the ocean. It’s wonderful and adorable, and I’ll definitely return if I have the chance.",5,89,6
425,"Visiting the S.E.A. Aquarium at Resorts World Sentosa was like stepping into a living, breathing underwater world. With over 100,000 marine animals across 1,000 species, the scale and variety are truly breathtaking. One of the highlights is the massive Open Ocean Habitat — its floor-to-ceiling viewing panel offers an unforgettable, immersive view where manta rays and sharks glide past gracefully, almost as if in slow motion.  The aquarium is cleverly divided into themed zones representing different marine ecosystems. From the vibrant Coral Garden to the thrilling Shark Seas, each area is both visually stunning and rich with educational content. The informative displays and interactive touch pools kept both kids and adults engaged, making it a fun and meaningful experience for the whole family.  We found that arriving early helped us enjoy the exhibits at a relaxed pace before peak crowds arrived. Plan to spend at least 2–3 hours to truly soak in everything. If you're up for a deeper experience, the VIP tour offers behind-the-scenes access and up-close interactions with marine life — well worth it!  Overall, the S.E.A. Aquarium is more than just a tourist attraction; it's an inspiring dive into the wonders of the ocean, leaving you both awed and more appreciative of marine life.",5,89,1
426,"Singapore Zoo is one of the attractions that I think anyone visiting Singapore — especially families with kids — should experience at least once. The zoo is well-known for its lush, green surroundings and open-concept animal enclosures, which feel much more natural and friendly compared to traditional zoos.  You can choose to explore the zoo by tram, which helps save energy — especially if you’re visiting with children or elderly family members. However, if you’re up for it, walking is also highly recommended because it lets you observe the animals up close and discover small corners that you might miss otherwise. I strongly suggest checking the map and show schedule in advance so you can plan your route and arrive at the show areas on time. The animal shows — like the elephant, sea lion, or bird shows — are really entertaining and educational, so don’t miss them!  The only downside, in my opinion, is that the dining area is too small for the large number of visitors, especially on weekends or holidays. Sometimes you’ll have to wait quite a while to find a seat. That said, the food stalls offer a good variety, service is relatively quick, and the system is well-organized, so even when it’s crowded, things stay manageable. One small drawback is that the exit signs aren’t very clear, so it took me a while to figure out how to get out when I was done.  My tip is to buy your tickets online beforehand so you don’t waste time lining up at the entrance — especially on busy days. Overall, Singapore Zoo is a wonderful, nature-friendly experience for both adults and kids, and it will definitely add special memories to your trip.",5,90,1
427,"The park is very well kept and clean. The animals look healthy and active. We arrived at 10am+ and it was a perfect timing where you see all the animals active. The weather is hot but breezy at the same time. Tipping hottest at noon, I advise visitors to come earlier have your breakfast at the cafe just outside the entrance. Reasonably priced and fast fix.  A tip to give all visitors, we hopped on the tram in the park upon arrival and took a tour for one full loop. Identifying zones we wish to visit first and then we stroll around on foot. It makes the whole experience so much better than just diving in on foot at the getgo. After covering all the zones by foot, we took the tram for one loop again to check if we missed any enclosures. And finally we are happy we have covered all of the enclosures.  Enjoyed my visit.",5,90,2
428,"Easily the best zoo I’ve ever visited. The “enclosures” were very spacious and natural; all the animals looked happy and comfortable. You get a wonderful view of their daily habits, almost like you were visiting them in the wild. The conservation efforts of the zoo are commendable as well.",5,90,3
429,"A very well maintained zoo, very neat and clean, as the whole of Singapore is. We went on a Friday, as we had read about avoiding weekends. We reached around 12, so it was not crowded at the entrance, but we had already bought the tickets online. It is quite big, but walking and exploring animal different enclosures is the best option to see most animals. Though they had lot n lots of animals, but few big ones were missing. Overall a 5 star experience.",5,90,4
430,"Budgeted post birthday event.  We are going to the Zoo although it is short in distance and a price tag but not lacking in quality, substance and effort.  Cooked two of her favourite dish, scallion oil stored fried noodles with vegetables and garlic fried rice for lunch and packed enough food, drinks, snacks for her munching pleasure.  Brought umbrella and fan to ensure a pleasant cooling trip.  Lastly, being her jester for the day by doing lame and funny stuffs to make her day more enjoyable.",5,90,5
431,One of the coolest place to see the pandas and fish. Nice and clean area with good facilities to stroll with young kids. Also the animal presentation are nice and exciting experience for families. Giant fish tanks are wonderful and fish and animals are from both freshwater and sea water,5,91,1
432,"It was an absolutely amazing experience at River Wonders! There are so many aquatic animals to see, including giant river otters, giant freshwater stingrays, and even pandas. The manatees were the highlight for us. So funny and interesting to watch them glide around. The whole place is very family and kids friendly, and you can easily spend hours there. Make sure to check the opening times if you want to join other tours on the same day. A fantastic and memorable day out for all ages!",5,91,2
433,"The design of the park was quite weather proof. Though it was raining when we went, most of the attractions can still be visited. Animal show have to be pre booked but it was a little underwhelming. Overall, family friendly and worth a visit.",4,91,3
434,"We really enjoyed the river wonders. It's kinda far from the place we were staying but Singapore has an efficient transport system so going here is not a problem. This is only a part of a zoo I think but this is big enough for a days trip. My favourite parts are the pandas, red panda, the manatees and of course the capybaras. There's also a restaurant here and I love the panda buns, they have different flavours, my favourite one is the green one - I think it's pandan flavored. Chicken burgers are also served with fries and have a big serving. One would recommend River wonders for those who love animals and those who love new knowledge about wild life.",5,91,4
435,"We had a great time at River Wonders!  It wasn’t crowded, so it was easy to walk around and enjoy everything.  The signs and info were clear and easy to understand. I really liked how thoughtful they were — like offering stroller rentals for kids. I also appreciated the many fans along the walkways, which really helped because it can get quite hot.  Even though it’s not a huge place, we spent about 3 hours there. The staff were friendly and helpful too.  Would definitely recommend!  Don’t really need to get tickets in advance(:",5,91,5
436,Very nice experience with my family enjoying the fireworks at night - The process is smooth and supported by friendly staff - Views are breathtaking over sentirás island and the harbor. Booking tickets in advance is a plus to avoid queues in crowded days,5,92,4
437,"Singapore Cable Car offers stunning views of the city and Sentosa, making it a fun and unique way to travel. The ride is smooth, the cabins are clean and air-conditioned, and the views—especially at sunset—are unforgettable. Great for all ages!",5,92,5
438,I believe it's a must do when visiting Singapore. The Cable Car allows you to get a scenic view of the Harbour and Sentosa Island from above. I would suggest to get a day pass so that you can do the round trip at your ease!,5,92,6
439,It's a great way to reach Sentosa island. They have new glass floor cars too but I was too scared to try them. This gets busy very quickly so buy tickets ahead of time.,4,92,1
440,"Such a cool way to get to and from sentosa, highly recommend doing the cable car atleast once. If you get nervous at heights like me, its actually really high up, but still incredible to see singapore from a birds eye view!",5,92,2
441,"Very well designed night safari that is considerate to both the animals and the people. The walking trails are the highlight for me, it is said to take 1 hour, but it took 2 hours for us. It is fun to take some time to spot the animals. We actually got to see most of them. The feeding areas are strategically placed near the window, so most of the time the animals will hang around the front and you can see them clearly. It's also amazing that there are many animals available to see here that you normally don't see anywhere or at other regular morning zoos. Something like the Tasmanian devil, Hyenas, Armadillo, Giant Anteater, you won't get to see in Asia unless you visit the zoos in Africa or Australia for example. It really blew away my expectations.  We didn't catch the show because we took too long walking the trails, but it was worth it. Then the safari tram was a relaxing way to end the day.",5,93,4
442,One of the best experiences we had was that their lion was so close to us. We had a great tram ? ride. The animal shows amazing we had never seen this type of trained animal. The animal keepers were trained too. An Indian food shop was also there. The zoo feels like a real jungle well-maintained.,5,93,5
443,"Nice & clean trails. Animals are not that active at 7pm-8pm. Probably better to go at 9pm onwards.  To board the tram, there’s only one place to board, which is near the entrance of the park. If you decided to walk, need to continue on the footpath for your whole journey.  Overall experience was quite pleasant!",5,93,6
444,"Absolutely loved my visit to the Night Safari! The amphitheater show was a highlight — so fun and engaging — and I totally fell in love with Toffee the raccoon ?. I came hoping to see the kiwi, wallaby, anteater, Tasmanian devil, tapir, and sloth bear, and I’m thrilled I saw them all! The walking trails are a great immersive experience, but if you want to cover more ground quickly, the tram is a lifesaver. I really appreciate how Mandai educates about endangered animals and actively works to conserve and care for them. Truly a magical and meaningful night out!",5,93,1
445,"An absolute must do when visiting Singapore with children. My kids loved it almost as much as I did. Make sure you book tickets well in advance as they do book up. The night safari itself emphasises education about the animals and conservation of their environments.  The queue for the tram took around 20 minutes. Be careful if you are taking a buggy as some of the lanes nearer the front get quite narrow and can block buggies. The animal enclosures are excellent and, because of the way they manage the enclosures, the animals are fairly active. We saw Lions, hippos, hyenas, pangolins, bears….and the list goes on and on. The walking trails are great and take about two hours to get around properly, which can mean a late night for the kids so plan what you want to see properly. Seriously, go here. It. Is. Fantastic.",5,93,2
446,"I really love nature. You will enjoy exploring the island by bike particularly the well- maintained roads and trails leading to abandoned quarries, mangrove swamps, and treetop views. It’s really safe to visit but my advice don’t bring food or plastics that the monkey can see. They will sure attacked. ?????",5,94,4
447,"Visited this charming little island of Singapore where we embarked on an island tour. An informative tour with a knowledgeable guide, sharing his passion & informations he knew abt the island.",4,94,5
448,"A magnificent and exotic island rich in biodiversity, in particular, the Chek Jawa wetlands, which showcases a fascinating array of flora and fauna not commonly seen in mainland Singapore. The well-placed cycling and walking paths on the island make for an exciting and eye-opening trip for both tourist and local families, as well as nature-loving individuals... highly recommended...",5,94,6
449,"Great experience. Amazing community, very different to mainland Singapore. It is a large island, so make sure to have a few hours to see it properly, and hire a bike to be able to see as much as you can. There is a fun mountain biking track on the west side of the island with routes suitable for beginners. The board walk through mangroves was a highlight, we saw lots of wildlife like otters, monkeys, monitor lizards and many more. There is a number of options for food on the island, but make sure to bring cash, the bikes, ferry and the food are cash only.",5,94,1
450,Laid back island of Singapore.  Board bumboat from changi point ferry terminal. No scheduled time. Bumboat will move once hit 12 person sitting capacity. Pay cash on board. $4 each on weekday (one way).  Laid back island for slower pace of life. No fancy restaurant or hotels. Just kampung life. Easy to get around in bikes. Plenty of bike rental. By foot is possible. Van taxi are also plenty. Few food choices. Homely and enough. Plenty of insect and mosquitos. Bring insect Repellant. No water coolers but the shop near jetty sells drinks. Vending drinks machines also avail at key point. Great place to past the day.,5,94,2
451,Very good initiative to bride our younger generation with our origin and educate our heritage in an excellent manner.  They exhibit rare artifacts and take us to different timeline. Also we can feel the early settlements and historical facts in a lively manner.,5,95,2
452,"We braved the hot weather and went on a Sunday. Yea. Forgot it was not the best day to go. But didn't regret. There were free vadai and masala tea upon arrival. Some booths for activities and the rest of the museum were on 3rd and 4th floor. At the end of the tour, free packet drinks were given out. Overall, nice tour. We took about an hour. As a Singaporean, we felt we should go take a look and we loved it.",5,95,3
453,This is a dynamic cultural center with something for folks of all ages. There are interactive exhibits for kids as well as detailed information  Supporting these kinds of centers is important for people of Indian heritage and others alike. It helps to see the strength and diversity of various cultural communities.,5,95,4
454,Interesting to understand the history of Indians in Singapore from past to the present. The exhibition set up is good. Not crowded during the weekend.,5,95,5
455,"An excellent museum of two floors of permant exhibition, strating from the 4th floor then the 3rd.  Thiis place is organized and managed, with the foreign admission of SGD 8.",5,95,6
456,"The area is filled with modern malls, luxury boutiques, and a wide variety of restaurants and cafes. It’s also very clean, well-maintained, and easy to navigate with public transportation. Whether you’re looking to shop, dine, or just enjoy the city’s lively atmosphere, Orchard Road offers an unforgettable experience for both tourists and locals",5,96,6
457,"Luxury shopping mall with a wide variety of stores — you can find almost anything you need here. Naturally, prices are on the higher side. Conveniently accessible via Orchard MRT. The Apple Store stands out with its stunning design. I would definitely come back again.",5,96,1
458,Walking alone the city of Singapore where people are very respectful and responsible. You cannot see a single garbage on the street. It blown my mind how clean and organized Singapore is.,5,96,2
459,"Great shopping street, all ranges",5,96,3
460,"Orchard Road is truly a shopper’s paradise and so much more than just a street lined with malls. I didn’t go there for major shopping, but I really enjoyed walking around, exploring the unique architecture of each shopping complex, and taking lots of photos.  Every mall has its own personality—ION Orchard looks super futuristic, Paragon feels upscale and elegant, and 313@Somerset has a younger, trendier vibe. The buildings themselves are quite photogenic, especially if you love capturing modern urban design. Even just window shopping was fun!  The whole area is clean, lively, and well-organized. There are plenty of cafes and restaurants where you can take a break, and the sidewalks are wide and shaded with trees, which makes walking more comfortable, even on a sunny day.  If you’re into architecture or street photography, Orchard Road offers plenty of great angles—especially in the evening when everything lights up. It’s a great place to experience a different side of Singapore: stylish, energetic, and full of life.  Definitely worth visiting, even if you're not planning a shopping spree!",4,96,4
461,"This is a great place to spend few hours. Even though it is a popular spot, you will never find it cramped. There are options to take easy, moderate and difficult treks. I would definetly go again.",5,97,5
462,A must visit spot in Singapore if you love to explore trails and to trek in the jungle. Be wary of bringing along plastic bags as there are many monkeys.,5,97,6
463,"Such a beautiful walk! Beware of the monkeys, I saw one stealing some unattended drinks and another threatening one of the hikers. Also note that the route to tree top walk is one way, and has some stairs. It loops back to the main circular trail around Mac Ritchie. Took us 4 hours with lots of photo stops and breaks. Go early morning to avoid the sun.",5,97,1
464,"Visiting MacRitchie Reservoir in Singapore was a refreshing escape into nature. As Singapore's oldest reservoir, it offers a serene environment amidst lush greenery, providing a perfect setting for outdoor enthusiasts. The well-maintained trails and boardwalks meander through the forest, allowing for leisurely walks or more vigorous hikes. One of the highlights is the TreeTop Walk, a 250-meter suspension bridge that offers panoramic views of the forest canopy, making the trek worthwhile. ​  The reservoir is also a haven for wildlife; during my visit, I encountered various bird species and playful macaques. It's advisable to keep a safe distance from the animals and avoid bringing food in plastic bags, as it can attract the monkeys.  For those interested in water activities, kayaking is available, providing a different perspective of the reservoir's beauty. The calm waters make it suitable for beginners and offer a peaceful experience away from the bustling city.​  Amenities such as restrooms and water refill stations are conveniently located along the trails, ensuring a comfortable visit. It's recommended to wear comfortable footwear and bring sufficient water, especially if planning to complete the full trail loop. ​  Overall, MacRitchie Reservoir is a gem within Singapore, offering a blend of natural beauty, recreational activities, and tranquility. Whether you're a local or a tourist, it's a must-visit destination for those seeking to connect with nature.​",5,97,2
465,"Nice Trails. One of my favourite places in SG. Always nice for photography and spotting all kinds of animals. Tree top walk is worth it. Pack an umbrella for sunprotection and enough water, some parts of the trails have no shade options. Would recommend coming early in the morning.  My happy place :)",5,97,3
466,"The place has many vintage bookstores with books unique old second hand books, the bookstores sell at a cheaper price than normal bookstores. There is also the central popular bookstore so it is worth a look for locals and tourists alike. Overall, the experience there was enjoyable.",4,100,6
467,"It's slightly different now, but it used to be heaven because I love books. There were stores and stores full of books and I could spend hours roaming through them. Now, when everything changes to digital and the interest of book has unfortunately dwindled down,  and some of my favorite shops are gone, I don't visit this place as often.  At least, it has Art and Friends here, which is probably one of the last interest. There is still a bookstore, but the charm of weird and wonderful collections of books is not as what it used to be.  It is still charming though, a older style of shopping complex with its unique shop compared to modern malls that populate the rest of Singapore.  Come here by City Hall or Brass Basah MRT. There is motorcycle and car parking as well.",4,100,1
468,"1.	“A Book Lover’s Paradise!” Bras Basah Complex is an absolute gem for book lovers! It’s a haven of second-hand bookstores, niche bookshops, and specialty art stores. I always discover hidden treasures and unique titles that you can’t find elsewhere. The retro vibe of the place adds to its charm—perfect for a relaxing afternoon. 2.	“Great for Art Supplies and Stationery!” This is my go-to place for all things art and stationery. From professional-grade materials to affordable supplies for hobbyists, Bras Basah Complex has it all. Art Friend is a standout store here, offering a wide variety of products. The staff are knowledgeable and always ready to help. 3.	“A Slice of Old-School Singapore!” Bras Basah Complex offers a nostalgic experience. The mix of independent stores, cozy cafes, and niche shops feels like stepping back in time. It’s a refreshing break from modern malls and a great spot to find unique items and support local businesses. 4.	“Perfect for Collectors and Hobbyists!” Whether you’re into vintage books, rare comics, or musical instruments, Bras Basah Complex has something for everyone. I’ve found amazing deals on preloved books and vinyl records. The shop owners are friendly and passionate about what they sell. 5.	“Hidden Gem for Unique Gifts!” If you’re looking for one-of-a-kind gifts, Bras Basah Complex is the place to visit. From beautifully crafted notebooks to handmade art pieces, there’s something special for everyone. It’s a treasure trove of creativity and culture!",5,100,2
469,This place is a precious oldie. It has undergone a lot of makeover. Last time Swee Lee Music Shop used to be here. So much memories. Anyway it's still the place to get the 10 year series exam paper. And the food court had a renovation last year. It is looking great. A nice affordable alternative if you are studying at the National Library beside.,5,100,3
470,"Besides book stores , there are musical instruments, sports and “treasure” stores. PRICES ARE NEGOTIABLE for some stores so please don’t feel embarrass to make offers to make a deal ?",3,100,4
