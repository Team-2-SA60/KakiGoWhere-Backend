I truly appreciated the respectful atmosphere and the sense of history there. The area is very clean, the people around were kind, and I felt so happy to discover such a charming and meaningful spot.

The old chapel is stunning, and if you look closely at the top of the columns, you’ll find tropical flowers and birds carved in, like someone said, “Let’s make this place gorgeous, but make it extra.” And they did.\n\nOne of the most touching spots? A little gate called the Gate of Hope on Victoria Street. This was where babies were once left to be cared for by nuns. Yeah, I know, suddenly you’re not just sipping an iced latte in a pretty place, you’re standing in living history. Wild, right?\n\nBut then… the sun sets. And bam, CHIJMES transforms into this lively, sparkling maze of restaurants and bars. One second you’re in quiet reflection mode, next you’re Googling “How many tapas is too many tapas?” while live music spills out from somewhere nearby. There’s food from everywhere, Spain, India, maybe even your future favorite.\n\nIt’s elegant without being stiff, historical without being dusty, and social without being overwhelming.

Its stunning Neo-Gothic architectural style, featuring tall white columns and beautifully arched ceilings that create a sense of serenity.

Clusters of seniors huddle over games of \"big checkers\", their wooden pieces slamming down with the gravitas of chess grandmasters.\n\nTourists pause to watch, charmed by the spectacle, but it’s clear this is no performance. The players’ intensity — eyes narrowed, fingers tapping the grid between moves — hints at \"decades\" of rivalry, and perhaps a few discreet wagers.

We had no regrets booking our tickets online and making the visit. Although our reservation was for 3 PM, we arrived earlier, and the attendants kindly allowed us entry.\n\nIt was a quiet afternoon with fewer visitors, giving us the chance to explore at our own pace, read the exhibits, and take photos without obstruction. Our first impression was that the place is well-maintained and clean. It was truly an eye-opening experience to learn about Singapore’s history and the struggles of early immigrants who arrived in Nanyang, hoping to find prosperity.\n\nThis heritage centre is an insightful visit, especially for younger generations, as it provides valuable knowledge about our ancestors who settled here. The centre also offers videos that showcase historical events and experiences. However, visitors should be mindful when walking down the narrow and dimly lit staircase—we chose not to take the lift.\n\nOverall, it’s a highly recommended visit for anyone interested in Singapore’s rich heritage.',5,10,5),(45,'Pretty fun, well-thought and curated museum that gives you a glimpse of the genesis of Chinatown in Singapore, through the lense of migrant workers, how they lived and earned a living, and how it all set a foundation for the modern yet traditional lifestyle we all know today.

Thian Hock Keng Temple is one of the oldest and most important Hokkien temples in the city, originally built in the 1830s by early Chinese immigrants giving thanks for safe passage across the sea. It’s dedicated to Mazu, the Goddess of the Sea — very fitting considering Telok Ayer Street used to border the old shoreline before land reclamation.\n\nThe architecture is stunning, with intricate carvings, colourful tiles, and dragons coiling up the rooftop. No nails were used in the original construction — a real testament to traditional Chinese craftsmanship. You can really feel the cultural and spiritual significance as you walk through the temple courtyard.\n\nIt’s a peaceful retreat from the city buzz, and a must-see if you’re exploring Chinatown or interested in Singapore’s multicultural heritage. A hidden gem for those who love history, art, and architecture.',5,11,3),(47,'I visited the Thian Hock Keng temple and it was a very peaceful visit. This is the oldest temple in Singapore and has Chinese heritage in terms of the impressive architecture. The temple is open during day time and you don\'t need a ticket to enter.

It’s like a mini museum but it has quite a myriad of artefacts. It is well worth a visit!',5,12,2),(52,'I would have given 4.5 stars for the exhibition but we had the strangest experience upon entering which in fact deserves one star. The female at the counter assumed I was a foreigner (foreigners pay a small sum to enter). I told her I was PR and my daughter a citizen. Instead of politely asking for my ID she very roughly demanded “show me” twice. I wanted a nice experience for my 8yo daughter so I complied without fuss. She then turned to my young girl and said she must pay. I was confused. I repeated that my daughter was a local Singaporean but she refused to believe me. It’s only when my Singaporean husband entered that she backed down. Nice introduction to the Eurasian community!\n\nUnfortunately they no longer have an activity book/pack for children so I hope if they read this they’ll reintroduce one as the children would gain far more from the actual exhibition.\n\nAs for the exhibit itself, it’s quite good though a little crammed with information but I understand space is a constraint.\n\nWould recommend if you’re combining a trip with the gorgeous downstairs Eurasian restaurant “Quentins” which my family and I love. Otherwise, given the odd reception by that woman, I’d give the exhibit a miss.',3,12,3),(53,'Just joined the Eurasian Association and was there for a welcoming ceremony.

Quite small and located on the floors above, there is a lot of history packed into such a small place. I was fascinated by all the memorabilia and stories about the western influence on Singapore. I was even amazed to find my own surname which is quite localised to where I am from displayed amongst the collection with a coat of arms and the reference used which influenced the naming of a street. I spent about 30 mins although could have easily spent an hour going through all of the gallery.',5,12,6),(56,'It’s okay.

Inside, the concert halls are world-class. Great sound, comfortable seating, and you really feel immersed in the performance. I once caught a live performance here and it gave me goosebumps.\n\nWhat I also like is that the whole area outside is super relaxing. You get an amazing view of Marina Bay Sands, and the vibe at night is peaceful and inspiring. There are often buskers and pop-up art displays, which makes the walk around even more lively.\n\nPerfect spot for both tourists and locals like me who just need a break from the city buzz without going too far.

The displays of various plants from around the world were very well done and expertly curated. From desert plants to rainforest, they seem to have just about everything. Plus amazing flower displays. We went in the morning and the crowds weren’t too bad. Didn’t have to wait for Entry. The price of entry was quite reasonable given all of the displays around the garden. This is certainly a must do attraction to visit on a trip to Singapore. And if it looks like rain, just plan to be in one of the domed exhibits and you’ll be fine. We were there during a storm and by the time we were finished touring the exhibit the rain was over and we were able to walk all over the grounds.',5,15,5),(68,'We loved Gardens by the Bay.

Due to a medical situation involving an injured member of our group, we requested a change in room location to better accommodate their condition. Unfortunately, we felt that our concerns were not met with the level of responsiveness or support we had previously experienced. What could have been a relatively simple adjustment became a prolonged and exhausting process.\n\nWe were eventually offered new rooms two days later, but by then, we were too worn out to move again.\n\nThat said, we would like to recognize Samuel Lee, the Assistant Front Office Manager, who made a significant difference on our last day. He took the time to listen, understand our concerns, and offer genuine reassurance. His professionalism and care restored our confidence in the service we had come to appreciate and it is largely because of this positive interaction with Samuel that we would return.\n\nOn another note, we also noticed some areas for improvement in the Executive Lounge. There is of lack attention to detail in the service of certain dishes, drinks, and the setup of the mini buffets(cheese platters with not the right cheese knives,no spoons to scoop honey/jams). Orders were occasionally mixed up, the quality of the coffee could be enhanced. With a bit more consistency and attentiveness, the overall experience in the lounge could better match the standards expected at this level of hospitality.',4,17,3),(77,'The hanging gardens are absolutely stunning and make this hotel feel like no other. A unique blend of urban luxury and tropical nature. It genuinely felt like living in a tropical oasis right in the heart of the city.\n\nThe natural light in the room made the space feel much larger and more open, and the glass shower overlooking the city added a special touch that made the stay feel truly memorable and luxurious.\n\nThe breakfast was good, with a decent variety and quality.\nBut what stood out most was the exceptional service: truly 10 out of 10. The staff were attentive, warm, and made the experience seamless and elevated.',5,17,4),(78,'Really love the greenery of the whole hotel when I walk in. Amazing design, cozy and relax. They have one of the most amazing hotel buffet in Singapore. I am a buffet lovers, and this one really caught my heart. I always come back for their lobster buffet, incredible standards, a lot of varieties of lobster, even have the most amazing Sarawak pepper lobster flavour. So fragrant, the spiciness is just nice.',5,17,5),(79,'We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The staff were very friendly, the service was excellent, and the view was amazing. The location is also great—close to an MRT station and surrounded by plenty of food options. I would highly recommend staying here, and I’d definitely come back myself.',5,17,6),(80,'Green on the outside, dull as soon as you step in the room. These rooms should be full of lush greenery!\n\nBreakfast is not included in the room rate and one is forced to get up super early on the account of not enough space in the restaurant to accommodate all the guests.\n\nOther than that the beds are comfortable and room size is sufficient, but that does not justify the outrageously high price.',4,17,1),(81,'Very poor customer service. Never answer to questions asked. Sent multiple email rephrase to specific questions many times but only received general answer. Seems like not interested in whether any student enrolment. May be a lot of funding available,  unlike some others private centers has quicker response and close follow up.',1,18,5),(82,'Writing this review in response to how my application was handled very poorly\n\nI will admit I submitted it late by a day, but that was due to the staff\'s inadequate knowledge and told me to use an OpenCert which was wrong so I had to go find my physical certs and that wasted time\n\nBut all that does not justify why I applied the same time as a friend who just finished her A Levels, both went in at the start of February right after the Open House. She auditioned in late February and got in. While mine was pushed so far until mid April and what I noticed was of the 7 candidates, 5 were from ITE, as we found out while waiting, and this led me to believe they think that A Level & Poly students alike are \"smarter\" and ITE ones are \"stupider\"\nAnd 1 of the 7 was from Poly whose first slot was in Feb, but missed it and got another slot in Apr!\n\nUltimately I was rejected and while upset, is not the focal point of my review, rather the way my certs got me treated.\n\nLASALLE should NOT be picky based on their certs and as such us ITE students have no chance to appeal as \"it is too late in the semester\" but those who audition earlier can as they were given earlier slots. Seemingly based on certs.\nThose who apply first should audition first, and not have LASALLE cherry pick slots for candidates based on certs.\n\nI wanted a Diploma in Performance so much but given how they treated me, I won\'t at all be shocked if my slot for the AY2026 gets pushed to April.\n\nTime will tell as to the validity of my claims.\nIf once again I get delayed, it\'s clear they want to give less priorities to Higher NITEC holders\n\nBecause if this is the case and I get shelved to Apr 2026, I will NOT be returning to LASALLE. At this point, their claims to give students equal opportunities and overlook differences such as disabilities (I have some), race or qualifications. All of that all feels like lip service to exude a positive image\n\nI\'m not making excuses to soften the blow of rejection, but recapping how unfair it is to be unable to appeal because I \"auditioned late\".\nI only \"auditioned late\" only because they kept me until the last slot, 15 April when I applied on 3 February\n\nIf I get the last slot again, it is clear that despite their \"equal opportunities\" claim, LASALLE gives priority to A level and Poly diploma holders, and give less opportunities to Higher NITEC holders. My application for AY2026 was submitted the day after my rejection, being mid May 2025 and will be with the general intake in Oct 2025. So there is no excuse to delay me to May 2026 then unless they truly segregate based on qualifications\n\nIf I get delayed again to Apr 2026 for the last slot with other ITE graduates, I will void my application and pursue my dreams of being an actor elsewhere, anywhere where I do not get segregated because of my certs.\n--\nIn short, I was given the last audition in Apr for a Diploma in Performance in February.\nI was rejected and I couldn\'t appeal because I auditioned late. And I only auditioned late because LASALLE gave me a late slot. And when I arrived I was with mostly ITE graduates many of whom applied in late March, even April and mine was in early February, which to me means slots are given based on certs and not a matter of first come first serve.\nIn film, rejection will happen, but the lead up to it is what frustrates me\n\nI\'m still very heartbroken as I applied in February and wasted months until April and turned away in May. Honestly I want to withdraw my application for AY2026 seeing how I was held back. My ambition was just learn the craft of being an actor\n\nAnd a large part is due to LASALLE shelving ITE students until the end, where it\'s too late to appeal. For rejection, I\'ve accepted it. If someone outdid me, that is fair and square.\nI applied early yet was kept until the last slot where I can\'t appeal. And that is what hurts me so much. If I could appeal like those with early slots, I would not be writing this. But I could not, hence the review.\n\nThis review is not to hurt LASALLE\'s image. I only wanted to bring to light what I went through',1,18,6),(83,'The art school building is absolutely breathtaking, almost like something straight out of Westworld, which was actually filmed there. Its futuristic and one-of-a-kind design makes it well worth a visit.

I explored the exterior and took a number of photos, but could not explore inside.\n\nDesigned by Singapore-based RSP Architects, the campus is an ingenious exercise of reworking space. From the outside, visitors are confronted by a black monolithic exterior of stone and aluminium punctuated with irregularly-shaped windows.\n\nThis illusion of continuity disappears when visitors enter the building, with its six seven-storey-high buildings, linked by an atrium and sky bridges.

The serene environment invites reflection and remembrance, making it an ideal place for visitors to pay their respects. The memorial features a striking columbarium, where the ashes of many soldiers are interred, alongside a wall inscribed with the names of those who were lost but not found.\n\nWhat is particularly fascinating about Kranji War Memorial is its emphasis on the role of Indian soldiers in the war. Many Indian troops fought under British command, displaying immense courage and resilience. The memorial highlights their significant contributions, which are often overshadowed in broader historical narratives. This recognition fosters a deeper understanding of the diverse backgrounds of those who fought for liberation.\n\nVisiting Kranji is an enlightening experience, as it encourages visitors to reflect on the complexities of colonial history and the sacrifices made by individuals from various backgrounds. The memorial also serves as an educational resource, shedding light on the lesser-known aspects of World War II in Southeast Asia.\n\nIn conclusion, Kranji War Memorial is not just a site of remembrance; it is a powerful testament to the shared history and sacrifices of soldiers from different cultures.

They asked me to show them my email, which i also did so. I passed my phone to their security, and while scrolling the mail, the mail was sent accidentally to my spam mail. That was when all my woes started. They said that I did not show them the mail and demanded to see it again. At this time, I did not know it was sent to my spam mail.

I used to think it was all a bit stuffy—people in black, playing long sad notes, lots of bowing. I’ve always been more of a casual listener (if that), and I definitely didn’t grow up going to concert halls. But something shifted.\n\nI watched my first full choral concert here a while back—a performance by the Voices of Singapore Ladies’ Choir. I didn’t expect much. I thought I’d be bored. Instead, I sat there, completely taken in. The harmonies, the precision, the way the sound filled the room—it got to me. I didn’t know music could feel that human and that powerful.\n\nMore recently, I actually performed here with the Singapore Symphony Chorus for Choral Encounters. Standing on that stage felt surreal. The acoustics are no joke—everything you sing comes back to you clean and balanced. It’s not flashy or high-tech, but it works. You don’t have to push; the hall does a lot of the work.\n\nThe venue itself is old-school, but in a good way. Built in 1905, restored nicely. Not huge, not small—just right. It’s right in the city centre, next to the river and some museums. Easy to get to. Comfortable seating, good visibility, nothing to complain about.\n\nI came in a skeptic and left feeling… moved?

To me, Victorial Concert Hall is a heritage space where heritage meets contemporary event comfort.\n\n?

The Museum curated a collection of toys and memorabilia from the era which paired really well with the look and feel of the movie itself. The ambience at MINT is exceptional and the Museum exhibitions bear all the marks of something hand-picked and scrutinised with excellent attention to detail.\n\nThe room where the movie was screened was spacious yet cozy, with very comfortable seating and cool air-conditioning throughout the space. It felt unique from the experience of a regular movie theatre, since the room doesn\'t get as dark it feels more like a communal viewing experience to be shared with friends and family, and you\'re able to glance around the displays within the room (which were curated to match the movie) if ever you find your eyes or attention wandering.\n\nOverall my trip to the MINT museum was an extremely enjoyable one, the space is lovely and extremely well cared for. It\'s definitely surprising the value they are able to squeeze out of the space they occupy, it is not only comparable to larger exhibitions at larger venues, I\'d argue it is greater in value because of the density and attention they provide towards their displays. There isn\'t any inch wasted with hastily installed attractions, every little detail is meticulously thought of, and you feel that detail instantly when you begin exploring the spaces.\n\nDefinitely would recommend other Singaporeans to visit and take note of this very unique part of our local arts/entertainment scene.

He was held captive by the Japanese Secret Police in Ipoh after a spy identified him as a member of the resistance army.\n\nDesigned by Ng Keng Siang, one of Singapore\'s pioneer local architects to graduate from London, the memorial occupies a site measuring 100 ft by 80 ft (30 m by 24 m), which was donated by the government.\n\nThe construction cost of $50,000 was funded by donations from the Chinese community. The memorial takes the form of a 3.6-metre-high octagonal pagoda made of bronze, concrete and marble. A bronze three-tier roof caps the pagoda, while four bronze lions stand guard at the base. Four bronze plaques placed around the pagoda give an account of Lim’s life in English, Chinese, Tamil and Jawi (Malay). On 28 December 2010, the Lim Bo Seng Memorial was gazetted as a national monument.\n\nIn 1946, the Lim Bo Seng Memorial Committee, which included representatives from the Chinese Nationalist government, was established to raise funds for the construction of a public memorial dedicated to Lim. The colonial government rejected the committee’s proposal to build a memorial park around his grave, but granted permission for a memorial to be built at the Esplanade. The British Commissioner-General for Southeast Asia at the time, Malcolm MacDonald, laid the foundation stone for the structure on 3 November 1953. The completed memorial was unveiled on 29 June 1954 by Charles Loewen, then commander-in-chief of the Far East Land Forces.\n\nTo note: After the war, Lim’s remains were disinterred from the jail in December 1945 and reburied in Singapore on 13 January 1946, on a hill overlooking MacRitchie Reservoir. In February 1946, the Chinese Nationalist government posthumously awarded him the rank of major-general.',5,65,1),(308,'As part of the WWII monument walk, this one certainly is a pretty stop.

Also, while the refill stations were handy, the water wasn’t chilled – and trust me, on a hot day, you’ll wish it was!\n\nStill, those are minor things. The overall experience was just beautiful.

However, if you’re up for it, walking is also highly recommended because it lets you observe the animals up close and discover small corners that you might miss otherwise. I strongly suggest checking the map and show schedule in advance so you can plan your route and arrive at the show areas on time. The animal shows — like the elephant, sea lion, or bird shows — are really entertaining and educational, so don’t miss them!\n\nThe only downside, in my opinion, is that the dining area is too small for the large number of visitors, especially on weekends or holidays. Sometimes you’ll have to wait quite a while to find a seat. That said, the food stalls offer a good variety, service is relatively quick, and the system is well-organized, so even when it’s crowded, things stay manageable. One small drawback is that the exit signs aren’t very clear, so it took me a while to figure out how to get out when I was done.\n\nMy tip is to buy your tickets online beforehand so you don’t waste time lining up at the entrance — especially on busy days. Overall, Singapore Zoo is a wonderful, nature-friendly experience for both adults and kids, and it will definitely add special memories to your trip.',5,90,5),(427,'The park is very well kept and clean. The animals look healthy and active. We arrived at 10am+ and it was a perfect timing where you see all the animals active. The weather is hot but breezy at the same time. Tipping hottest at noon, I advise visitors to come earlier have your breakfast at the cafe just outside the entrance. Reasonably priced and fast fix.\n\nA tip to give all visitors, we hopped on the tram in the park upon arrival and took a tour for one full loop. Identifying zones we wish to visit first and then we stroll around on foot. It makes the whole experience so much better than just diving in on foot at the getgo. After covering all the zones by foot, we took the tram for one loop again to check if we missed any enclosures. And finally we are happy we have covered all of the enclosures.\n\nEnjoyed my visit.',5,90,6),(428,'Easily the best zoo I’ve ever visited. The “enclosures” were very spacious and natural; all the animals looked happy and comfortable. You get a wonderful view of their daily habits, almost like you were visiting them in the wild. The conservation efforts of the zoo are commendable as well.',5,90,1),(429,'A very well maintained zoo, very neat and clean, as the whole of Singapore is. We went on a Friday, as we had read about avoiding weekends. We reached around 12, so it was not crowded at the entrance, but we had already bought the tickets online. It is quite big, but walking and exploring animal different enclosures is the best option to see most animals. Though they had lot n lots of animals, but few big ones were missing. Overall a 5 star experience.',5,90,2),(430,'The zoo is amazing! I really enjoyed how close the animals are to the audience. However, since it\'s outdoors, it can get quite warm, and there aren\'t any air-conditioned rest areas between sections.',5,90,3),(431,'Me and my wife visited River Wonders on a rainy Sunday. Thankfully, most of the exhibits are sheltered, so the wet weather didn’t spoil our visit and we could still enjoy seeing the animals—especially the giant pandas! The park is very clean, well-organized, and perfect for families with kids. However, the Amazon River Quest boat ride was suspended for a long time due to rain and thunder, which was disappointing since it\'s one of the main attractions.\n\nAbout the shows: the “Once Upon a River” presentation wasn’t as impressive as we hoped. The venue was small with limited seating and the arrangements weren’t very comfortable. On our visit, the park was really crowded. You have to book your show slot online, and it opens just 2 hours before the show—slots fill up in minutes! We were lucky to get a spot, but the area definitely needs to be bigger and better organized to handle the crowds.\n\nDespite a few downsides, we had an enjoyable and educational day. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a fun family outing—just plan ahead for the shows and expect a big crowd on weekends!',4,91,2),(432,'It was an absolutely amazing experience at River Wonders! There are so many aquatic animals to see, including giant river otters, giant freshwater stingrays, and even pandas. The manatees were the highlight for us. So funny and interesting to watch them glide around. The whole place is very family and kids friendly, and you can easily spend hours there. Make sure to check the opening times if you want to join other tours on the same day. A fantastic and memorable day out for all ages!',5,91,3),(433,'One of the coolest place to see the pandas and fish. Nice and clean area with good facilities to stroll with young kids. Also the animal presentation are nice and exciting experience for families. Giant fish tanks are wonderful and fish and animals are from both freshwater and sea water',5,91,4),(434,'We had a great time at River Wonders!\n\nIt wasn’t crowded, so it was easy to walk around and enjoy everything.\n\nThe signs and info were clear and easy to understand. I really liked how thoughtful they were — like offering stroller rentals for kids. I also appreciated the many fans along the walkways, which really helped because it can get quite hot.\n\nEven though it’s not a huge place, we spent about 3 hours there. The staff were friendly and helpful too.\n\nWould definitely recommend!\n\nDon’t really need to get tickets in advance(:',5,91,5),(435,'had a wonderful time at River Wonders! Loved the boat ride Amazon River Quest, and the enclosure Amazon Encounters. the animal show was good too but you must hook 2h in advance and it is booked out very quickly. Worth going down to see!',5,91,6),(436,'Very nice experience with my family enjoying the fireworks at night - The process is smooth and supported by friendly staff - Views are breathtaking over sentirás island and the harbor.\nBooking tickets in advance is a plus to avoid queues in crowded days',5,92,5),(437,'I believe it\'s a must do when visiting Singapore. The Cable Car allows you to get a scenic view of the Harbour and Sentosa Island from above. I would suggest to get a day pass so that you can do the round trip at your ease!',5,92,6),(438,'Such a cool way to get to and from sentosa, highly recommend doing the cable car atleast once. If you get nervous at heights like me, its actually really high up, but still incredible to see singapore from a birds eye view!',5,92,1),(439,'Great way to travel to Sentosa Island ! We got on at the Harbour front stop but went on both lines throughout the day. The ticket is excellent value for money because you could ride all day. The view from the cable cars is excellent and definitely should not be missed',5,92,2),(440,'Very enjoyable ride, especially if one is lucky enough to get the whole car for themself. The views are great, although I would appreciate them more if the weather was better (it was cloudy and raining).\nI bought the tickets online (Sentosa line + Mount Faber line combo), which was cheaper and faster than getting them at the ticketing counter.',5,92,3),(441,'The concept of the Night Safari is genuinely unique and exciting — the idea of exploring wildlife at night feels adventurous. The tram ride was comfortable and gave a good overview of the park, and the naturalistic habitats are well-maintained.\n\nHowever, the actual experience felt a bit underwhelming. Many animals were hard to spot due to low lighting (which I understand is for their comfort), and the crowd management could’ve been better — long queues even on weekdays. The Creatures of the Night show was decent, but nothing too thrilling.',3,93,2),(442,'Very well designed night safari that is considerate to both the animals and the people. The walking trails are the highlight for me, it is said to take 1 hour, but it took 2 hours for us. It is fun to take some time to spot the animals. We actually got to see most of them. The feeding areas are strategically placed near the window, so most of the time the animals will hang around the front and you can see them clearly. It\'s also amazing that there are many animals available to see here that you normally don\'t see anywhere or at other regular morning zoos. Something like the Tasmanian devil, Hyenas, Armadillo, Giant Anteater, you won\'t get to see in Asia unless you visit the zoos in Africa or Australia for example. It really blew away my expectations.\n\nWe didn\'t catch the show because we took too long walking the trails, but it was worth it. Then the safari tram was a relaxing way to end the day.',5,93,3),(443,'Highly recommend this activity! We booked the 9:45pm slot and it was perfect. You avoid a good chunk of crowd (especially the one with kids) and you end up with a quiet discovery of the park. The animals seem well taken cared of and we seriously could have spent 5 hours just sitting and admiring them. We stayed until midnight and even saw some employees feeding some animals.\n\nPs: PLEASE don’t use the flash to take pictures!!!! I saw so many people do this and it really angers me',5,93,4),(444,'I had a wonderful experience at the Night Safari in Singapore! The highlight for me was definitely the tram ride — it was relaxing, informative, and gave us a great view of the animals in their naturalistic habitats. The animal show was also fantastic — entertaining and educational, with well-trained animals and passionate staff.\n\nWalking through the trails at night added a special touch to the whole experience. It felt like a true adventure under the stars! Highly recommend it for families or anyone looking for a unique wildlife experience in Singapore.',5,93,5),(445,'One of the best experiences we had was that their lion was so close to us. We had a great tram ? ride. The animal shows amazing we had never seen this type of trained animal.\nThe animal keepers were trained too. An Indian food shop was also there.\nThe zoo feels like a real jungle well-maintained.',5,93,6),(446,'I really love nature. You will enjoy exploring the island by bike particularly the well- maintained roads and trails leading to abandoned quarries, mangrove swamps, and treetop views. It’s really safe to visit but my advice don’t bring food or plastics that the monkey can see. They will sure attacked. ?????',5,94,2),(447,'Visited this charming little island of Singapore where we embarked on an island tour. An informative tour with a knowledgeable guide, sharing his passion & informations he knew abt the island.',4,94,3),(448,'A magnificent and exotic island rich in biodiversity, in particular, the Chek Jawa wetlands, which showcases a fascinating array of flora and fauna not commonly seen in mainland Singapore. The well-placed cycling and walking paths on the island make for an exciting and eye-opening trip for both tourist and local families, as well as nature-loving individuals... highly recommended...',5,94,4),(449,'Great experience. Amazing community, very different to mainland Singapore. It is a large island, so make sure to have a few hours to see it properly, and hire a bike to be able to see as much as you can. There is a fun mountain biking track on the west side of the island with routes suitable for beginners. The board walk through mangroves was a highlight, we saw lots of wildlife like otters, monkeys, monitor lizards and many more. There is a number of options for food on the island, but make sure to bring cash, the bikes, ferry and the food are cash only.',5,94,5),(450,'It is a beautiful and exotic place for me.\nA Ferry was at 4$ by cash. It was departed once 12 of guests on board but not waited so long.\nOnce arrived in the island, there are several rental bike shops around $8-10.\nAlso, there are some places to eat. Otherwise, you can grab some food at the hawker center in the changi ferry point.\nWe went upto the wetlands. There is parking area for bicycles so you can walk along the trail. A whole trip to back to changi ferry point took around 3hours.',4,94,6),(451,'Very good initiative to bride our younger generation with our origin and educate our heritage in an excellent manner.\n\nThey exhibit rare artifacts and take us to different timeline. Also we can feel the early settlements and historical facts in a lively manner.',5,95,1),(452,'This is a dynamic cultural center with something for folks of all ages. There are interactive exhibits for kids as well as detailed information\n\nSupporting these kinds of centers is important for people of Indian heritage and others alike. It helps to see the strength and diversity of various cultural communities.',5,95,2),(453,'We braved the hot weather and went on a Sunday. Yea. Forgot it was not the best day to go. But didn\'t regret. There were free vadai and masala tea upon arrival. Some booths for activities and the rest of the museum were on 3rd and 4th floor. At the end of the tour, free packet drinks were given out. Overall, nice tour. We took about an hour. As a Singaporean, we felt we should go take a look and we loved it.',5,95,3),(454,'An excellent museum of two floors of permant exhibition, strating from the 4th floor then the 3rd.\n\nThiis place is organized and managed, with the foreign admission of SGD 8.',5,95,4),(455,'? FREE admission for all local Singaporean Citizens, PR and student pass holders!! Video is greatly created for a summary of Indian heritage history ??? Also like the staircase\'s design which can look at the street downstairs. Worth to visit!',5,95,5),(456,'The area is filled with modern malls, luxury boutiques, and a wide variety of restaurants and cafes. It’s also very clean, well-maintained, and easy to navigate with public transportation. Whether you’re looking to shop, dine, or just enjoy the city’s lively atmosphere, Orchard Road offers an unforgettable experience for both tourists and locals',5,96,5),(457,'Walking alone the city of Singapore where people are very respectful and responsible. You cannot see a single garbage on the street. It blown my mind how clean and organized Singapore is.',5,96,6),(458,'Luxury shopping mall with a wide variety of stores — you can find almost anything you need here. Naturally, prices are on the higher side. Conveniently accessible via Orchard MRT.\nThe Apple Store stands out with its stunning design. I would definitely come back again.',5,96,1),(459,'Great shopping street, all ranges',5,96,2),(460,'Orchard Road is truly a shopper’s paradise and so much more than just a street lined with malls. I didn’t go there for major shopping, but I really enjoyed walking around, exploring the unique architecture of each shopping complex, and taking lots of photos.\n\nEvery mall has its own personality—ION Orchard looks super futuristic, Paragon feels upscale and elegant, and 313@Somerset has a younger, trendier vibe. The buildings themselves are quite photogenic, especially if you love capturing modern urban design. Even just window shopping was fun!\n\nThe whole area is clean, lively, and well-organized. There are plenty of cafes and restaurants where you can take a break, and the sidewalks are wide and shaded with trees, which makes walking more comfortable, even on a sunny day.\n\nIf you’re into architecture or street photography, Orchard Road offers plenty of great angles—especially in the evening when everything lights up. It’s a great place to experience a different side of Singapore: stylish, energetic, and full of life.\n\nDefinitely worth visiting, even if you\'re not planning a shopping spree!',4,96,3),(461,'This is a great place to spend few hours. Even though it is a popular spot, you will never find it cramped. There are options to take easy, moderate and difficult treks. I would definetly go again.',5,97,6),(462,'A must visit spot in Singapore if you love to explore trails and to trek in the jungle. Be wary of bringing along plastic bags as there are many monkeys.',5,97,1),(463,'Visiting MacRitchie Reservoir in Singapore was a refreshing escape into nature. As Singapore\'s oldest reservoir, it offers a serene environment amidst lush greenery, providing a perfect setting for outdoor enthusiasts. The well-maintained trails and boardwalks meander through the forest, allowing for leisurely walks or more vigorous hikes. One of the highlights is the TreeTop Walk, a 250-meter suspension bridge that offers panoramic views of the forest canopy, making the trek worthwhile. ​\n\nThe reservoir is also a haven for wildlife; during my visit, I encountered various bird species and playful macaques. It\'s advisable to keep a safe distance from the animals and avoid bringing food in plastic bags, as it can attract the monkeys.\n\nFor those interested in water activities, kayaking is available, providing a different perspective of the reservoir\'s beauty. The calm waters make it suitable for beginners and offer a peaceful experience away from the bustling city.​\n\nAmenities such as restrooms and water refill stations are conveniently located along the trails, ensuring a comfortable visit. It\'s recommended to wear comfortable footwear and bring sufficient water, especially if planning to complete the full trail loop. ​\n\nOverall, MacRitchie Reservoir is a gem within Singapore, offering a blend of natural beauty, recreational activities, and tranquility. Whether you\'re a local or a tourist, it\'s a must-visit destination for those seeking to connect with nature.​',5,97,2),(464,'Nice Trails. One of my favourite places in SG.

Don’t wave snacks unless you want the whole gang showing up (plus there’s a fine for feeding them).\n\nThe real highlight is the Treetop Walk, a suspension bridge hanging above the forest canopy. Views are solid.\n\nThe place is big, green, and buzzing with life. You’ll hear birds, rustling leaves, maybe even catch a monitor lizard lazing about. Not the quietest trail, but definitely one of the most alive.',5,97,4),(466,'The place has many vintage bookstores with books unique old second hand books, the bookstores sell at a cheaper price than normal bookstores. There is also the central popular bookstore so it is worth a look for locals and tourists alike. Overall, the experience there was enjoyable.',4,100,1),(467,'It\'s slightly different now, but it used to be heaven because I love books. There were stores and stores full of books and I could spend hours roaming through them. Now, when everything changes to digital and the interest of book has unfortunately dwindled down,  and some of my favorite shops are gone, I don\'t visit this place as often.\n\nAt least, it has Art and Friends here, which is probably one of the last interest. There is still a bookstore, but the charm of weird and wonderful collections of books is not as what it used to be.\n\nIt is still charming though, a older style of shopping complex with its unique shop compared to modern malls that populate the rest of Singapore.\n\nCome here by City Hall or Brass Basah MRT. There is motorcycle and car parking as well.',4,100,2),(468,'1.	“A Book Lover’s Paradise!”\nBras Basah Complex is an absolute gem for book lovers! It’s a haven of second-hand bookstores, niche bookshops, and specialty art stores. I always discover hidden treasures and unique titles that you can’t find elsewhere. The retro vibe of the place adds to its charm—perfect for a relaxing afternoon.\n2.	“Great for Art Supplies and Stationery!”\nThis is my go-to place for all things art and stationery. From professional-grade materials to affordable supplies for hobbyists, Bras Basah Complex has it all. Art Friend is a standout store here, offering a wide variety of products. The staff are knowledgeable and always ready to help.\n3.	“A Slice of Old-School Singapore!”\nBras Basah Complex offers a nostalgic experience. The mix of independent stores, cozy cafes, and niche shops feels like stepping back in time. It’s a refreshing break from modern malls and a great spot to find unique items and support local businesses.\n4.	“Perfect for Collectors and Hobbyists!”\nWhether you’re into vintage books, rare comics, or musical instruments, Bras Basah Complex has something for everyone. I’ve found amazing deals on preloved books and vinyl records. The shop owners are friendly and passionate about what they sell.\n5.	“Hidden Gem for Unique Gifts!”\nIf you’re looking for one-of-a-kind gifts, Bras Basah Complex is the place to visit.
